208138,"Peels the paint off the walls: I first heard this album in the early 70's in high school. Now I've turned my own kids (21, 20, 16, 16 and 13) onto it. They can't believe that you could once go into a club and hear bands like this LIVE. They only listen to classic stuff I give them now; there's nothing on the radio that remotely comes close to the gut-wrenching energy of great musicians playing live at full throttle. If you only know Edgar Winter from his ""Frankenstein"" and ""Free Ride"" days, you've got an eye-opening experience ahead of you. Listen in particular to Edgar's 18 second full-throated stratospheric sustained vocal in Tobacco Road. You could refinish furniture by putting it in front of the speakers with this song turned up. An absolute MUST HAVE CD.

157010,"History With Modern Appeal: This is a must read for anyone interested in the history of the Caucausus and/or Russia. This is Blanch's tour de force, evidently the culmination of years of research and travel in the region, and she does not disappoint. The historical tale and larger than life personalities detailed are more than enough to hold a reader's interest. She manages to straddle the line between fact and romantic fiction, paying close attention to detail while never over-committing her sympathies to one side or the other.I can't speak to historical inconsistency here, not being a specialist in the area, that said, in a book of this scope, there is bound to be some. If you can put that aside, ""Sabres of Paradise"" is a sweeping, entertaining read, and a fascinating look into a world that has certainly passed, but whose remnants live in various movements throughout the world. Good book.

57708,"Deliberately Obtuse Nonsense: I don't know what kind of twisted brains would think this movie is great, ""one of the Coen brothers best"", but it is a sick movie with no redeeming message and no sympathetic characters. One feels obliged to watch it to conclusion because one hopes to find some kind of logic or some insight into what motivates the characters. The actors are wooden and often mumble, if they speak at all. There is nothing memborable, nothing to make you want to watch it again. Instead one feels it was a total waste of time to watch this degenerate crap. Fortunately I did not buy it but saw it on TV. I would not recommend anyone buy this DVD.

53010,"Its just not that good.: Well, one thing I will give Otep(the singer) credit is she has a very great growl, other then that it is just a poor quality album. Most of Otep Shamlay(?) vocals are either her moaning or giving us some female wigger rap hooks which makes her sound shameful, the guitarist offer nothing special, no solos, no strong lead guitar playing, bass is just there just really doing nothing, and the drummer is just blast beat yet no substance or quality drumming. Most of the songs try to be strong, plitical and sometimes its, oh, little poor me! writing, and she does it mostly moaning and then yelling and then whining. Overall this is really nothing special, if you want some good female fronted band, listen to Arch Enemy, Angela Gossow has better gutteral roars, Abbott Bros solo. and the bass is hearable and they have a great 2x kick drummer. Or listen to other death metal bands like, Venom, Celtic Frost, Obituary, Vader, Morbid Angel, Soilent Green, God Detroned and Nile instead.

I'm sure it would be fine for bikes with narrow tires, except on very thick bike racks.The mounting bracket is horrible. It cannot be properly secured to a bike frame, and after removing it once, the release for the locking tab was shot. Good thing the lock is small, because now I have to keep it in a handlebar bag.

I can't complain about the knives being dull since they're so cheap, so i won't. But i can complain about the fact that they rusted within 2 weeks of owning them. Not to mention that I don't have a dishwasher so i hand washed them. To be fair, the serated knives are all pretty good as far as sharpness is concerned but they rusted like all the rest. I'm not sure if I got sent a different set than all of the reviewers who gave this 5 stars, but heed my warning--you get what you pay for. I swear I could make a better set of knives out of play-doh. Maybe farberware would give me another set if i harass them for a few weeks, but i think I'm better off cutting my losses (no pun intended) and buying a real set from Henckels.

Meredith was annoying, Izzie pissed me off continually (and she is usually my FAV character), they introduced the Addison spin-off which I don't think I'll watch because I like her on Grey's and wish she would stay. I'm trying to review this without spoiling the plot for those who haven't yet seen it.The season finale was depressing. And not the good-depressing like the end of Season Two. This one just basically caused me to lose hope in the characters and in the story. Will I keep watching? Yes (yet reluctantly, I'm sad to say). There's a part of me that hopes next season redeems itself. But this season was such a downer and really annoyed me more than anything. I wouldn't buy it.

He then takes that premise and goes nowhere with it while describing the ills of the myth. The scientific part of his reasoning wanes as he goes more and more into the socio-political aspects of our society.Credibility turned to incredibility as his pick and choose logic and statistics became more prevalent. He complains that before present day affirmative action, whites had it, but it was called something else and criticizes it. Fine, but he then goes on to support affirmative action. After convincing me that race is a myth, he himself subsequently claims that churches are ""racially segregated"". I would have appreciated more on solutions than beratement of well known inequalities.But who is to say, it may be that the 4 enlightning statements that I got out of the entire last half of the book may end up being worthwhile.

Not Even Average Sound Quality.: Purchased these looking for even average sound quality simply to have decent audio while not disturbing others either as they work or later in the evening when kids go to bed.

I upgraded to a Samsung HD - LED system with a new, fairly high quality power strip with advanced filtering and surge protection. Among the numerous array of input/output connections, the Samsung actually has a phono out jack on the back allowing a direct and simple connection. Thought I'd give it a change with the new system> No difference whatsoever. I am not an audiophile so my expectations were modest.

190444,"This book was not helpful at all.: This author may have a degree, but she advocates pornography as something liberating. Having a degree in Women Studies myself, I know that a majority of those women that are photographed are being sexually exploited. Some are threatened with a gun. Others resort to drugs and alcohol to lower the inhibitions. These women are runaways from incestuous homes. They are an easy target for the pimps and tricks. Advocating porn is like applauding sexual explotation of many women. If they freely would have chosen to work in the porn industry, they would not organize against it afterwards. She says the nudes she used to draw are not porn. To the contrary, they look like something that might appear in Hustler.

56453,"Cool product design, problems with implementation: I love the design of this product. It's a USB key disk with a built-in MP3 player. It's tiny, and runs on a single AAA batter for several hours.Unfortunately, the firmware has trouble reading the filesystem properly, it seems. You can't, say, delete an MP3 and replace it with a different one. The player will begin jumping around between tracks and will then stop reading altogether. If you want to change some of the music on it, you need to reformat it and start from scratch. Similarly, you can't mix data files and MP3s. In part, I wanted to use the MuVo to shuttle files around, and it just isn't very good for that.

94306,"LOL not even worth review: I've been a die hard David Gray fan and waited years for this album. As soon as it was released I got it. First few tracks ok then it takes a nose dive. Some of the tracks are so bad you are left awestruck that David Gray could produce such diabolical quality. I mean the odd track has lyrics that Britney Spears could exceed.I played it 3 times when I got it, and it is so bad that I would quite happy throw it in the trash can. Because he dared put out such rubbish it has put me off playing all his former (and great) albums.Be warned. I thought this 6 months back and only posted the review today, so my opinion is solid on this one. And watch the Sony copyright protection and link to fix it does not open your PC to all kinds of problems (have a Google and you will see it is a danger).

281984,"Promising but not quite: I received this as a gift last year. I primarily use it for running and, since it's small and lightweight, it works well for this. Except... it is very ""glitchy."" If I'm in voice record mode and want to go into MP3 listening mode, it locks up and I have to remove the battery and replace to reset it. Actually, when going from radio mode to MP3 it sometimes locks up also. I contacted Sandisk customer service and they were of no help. Suggested I take it back and get a replacement. Well, I did this twice and all three units did the same thing, which tells me that Sandisk has a design issue. As long as you just want to listen to music and don't want the voice functions and radio, it will work fine but just beware that it may lock up on you and then you'll have to remove the battery to reset.Speaking of battery, it's terrible. It takes one AAA and I might get 4-5 1-hour running sessions in before I need to replace it.I'd look elsewhere personally.

The author personally tortured, hung, and shot numerous people, and the disturbing thing about it was how casual he was in doing so. Considering that he fought the Nazis in WWII with the French resistance, it's surprising how much he seems to have become like them (and how much the French occupation of Algeria looked like the German occupation of France). As for the book as a whole, it's well written and provides an important perspective on the conflict given his key role in it. It also provides a little bit of historic background about how the French experience in Vietnam, the rise of Arab nationalism etc. helped fuel the conflict. But all in all it's a pretty distasteful book (and that's from a person who's read lots of war chronicles).

There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences.

It just started to get retarded and boring. The Ending was Stupid and lame. Wish I never started to watch this show as it became a waste of time. I wouldnt even buy the seasons which I Didnt. They have all four seasons in Insant viewing on netflix. Which is where I watched it. If you consider watching it, watch it there and dont wast your money buying this. Just My Opinion.

33204,"babs blew it: Possibly the most disappointing adaptation I've ever seen. The character Susan was NOT the main focus of the story. The book mostly takes place in the past with flashes to the present, not the other way around. Leaving out the stories about the grandfather's cross and the white porpoise and the dead sea turtle . . . very disappointing. And messing up the story of Callanwold! I guess Babs would only do it if she were the star of the show. This book would be much better done in the style of a mini-series, allowing more time to cover more of the original story. One of the best books I've ever read, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Pat Conroy should be insulted.

72431,"Dinosaurs or Dragons?: Anne McCaffrey was my favorite author through middle school and high school, and she still sticks in my top 10. She has the ability to create an entire environment with believable characters, especially strong female leads (which seem to be lacking in most novels in the genre). If you have read her other books, this one should be on your list somewhere.Dinosaur Planet, and its sequel, though not as good as her Pern Series, are definitely still great sci-fi and worth a read. This is a really good choice for any 10-15 year old who is looking for some well-written, if older, sci-fi/fantasy novels or someone starting to branch out from the standard. It's a relatively short novel, and definitely well within the abilities of the average middle-schooler (and even some elementary school kids).

They do openly reflect the author's political leanings, but still help build a historical context that adds to the story.I still love Adah, as much as her sections would slow me down with the writing ... but also with the deep truths in her observations.Excellent writing, engaging characters and a peek into another world combine to make this one of my favorite books of the year.

Silk materials wear down very easily and the material can ""ball up"" creating those annoying lint balls. The last thing you want against your face are those things.Nylon/acrylic is more durable and feels just as silky smooth as real silk. They help you wick out the sweat and are easy to clean.I've sold balaclavas of different materials and find my customers overwhelmingly prefer the synthetic nylon/acrylic material.

156709,"Dixie Chicks make their best album yet: I think all the Dixie Chicks albums are masterpieces, but it seems like they do something a little different on each CD - improving a bit on the last one. It's the mark of a great artist. This CD is country/pop mixed with Americana and a little 70s era power pop. The lyrics show they aren't backing down, and cover various subjects - from country weepers to Alzheimers. There are not many uptempo songs, but for me, that is not a problem. Each Dixie Chicks CD offers the listener a different experience. The frantic ""Lubbock Or Leave It"" does get you moving just as much or more than any other Dixie Chicks song. This is an album that artists like Faith Hill might approach if they didn't have Nashville limitations. But it has a distinct Dixie Chicks flair. I'm a Democrat, but regardless of political affiliation, their CD should be recognized for the stellar album it is.

I virtually never buy books new -- but I bought this book based on the 90+ people saying it was fantastic... I expected to be blown away, but have been very disappointed. In addition, the text could be written much 'tighter', there is much superfluous copy, ie, seems to be padded to thicken the book.And to add to other negative reviews saying the Greek is not good, I now notice that the endorsers are not exactly known for their intellectual/theological rigor. I can't help but think that these very influential speakers have influenced some of their closer followers to pump this book.I really wish I had known about the free daily email version -- I'd love my $25 back too!

""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the best books I have ever read.The story is about a motherless tomboy named Scout who lives in a small town in Alabama and likes to play with her brother and friend, especially trying to learn more about their mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley. Their father, Atticus, is a wise, caring lawyer who has stirred up scandal for defending an African-American in court.Scout's voice is so well-written, you can almost hear her speaking to you in your ear...telling you about her childhood, how her brother, Jem, once ran up and actually TOUCHED the front door of Boo Radley's house. The story is really good. I would recommend this book to anyone.

You contact Nine Stars Products who tell you it's not their problem you need to contact Nine Stars Group USA, and the latter company is completely unreachable.

I can understand how he can't believe she didn't know but was just playing with his heart.

Forgiveness has to be done for the individual no matter how long the action happened. This book covers a lot but it is worth reading for anyone.

It comes already seasoned and is easy to clean, just follow the directions. No soap, hot water and a brush. The reason I'm giving it a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating is that it doesn't heat evenly on my stovetop.

It is like a never-ending tree with a never-ending maze! It is impossible to find your way around! No, a six-year-old will not have an easy time. I think that this game would be difficult for a six-year old, or seven, eight either. This game would be impossible for me without a strategy guide. If you get this game, I recommend you also get the strategy book with it. This game is a sequel to Paper Mario, but has more to it. Now, you can play as Bowser AND Peach at the end of each chapter. There are also twists and turns in the plot which make the game very exiting and interesting. Still, if you like a little challenge, I recommend this game.

23286,"Listenable but obviously without any major songs: This CD is a big disappointment. Beth Orton is my ""go-to"" listen; I can listen to her songs in any mood, at any time. This CD has some well-written songs, but there are only two songs (the first, ""Worms"", and ""Heartlandtruckstop"") that burst out of the speakers the way Beth Orton songs can. The rest are all absolutely listenable but none of the songs has that ""I must replay this song now"" moment.I am used to Beth's songs possessing many random moments of beauty, that are partly caused by the spareness of production. This CD all the songs sound pleasntly even on the EQ band, but they mostly lack the punchy lyrics or compelling music that grabs you. For instance, I heard many of these songs over and over again on the radio, but none stood out the way ""Stolen Car"" did or ""Mt. Washington"" did.Get Daybreaker instead for your Beth Orton space in your record collection.

I highly reccomend this CD- it epitomises NOFX for me, before they jumped on the political bandwagon. Punk in drublic also highly reccomended!

On the opposite extreme, it is not a book for the elite competitive swimmer.

The book is divided into various levels and utilizes all the strokes. The author also incorporates all the swimming toys (fins, pull buoys, paddles, etc.)The workouts are very creative and enjoyable. I often take the book to the pool (in a nylon bag). This is one of the best workout books I've seen. I purchased it a few years ago and have used it constantly.

AC/DC has made a career of writing songs that follow basically the same formula (Heavy with a memorable chorus and upbeat guitar solo) and this LP is definately in that category.I love it personally, but I'm very biased towards the band, but its still a good, hard hitting album worth having in every collection.

Basing his script on actual reformatories run in the 1960s by the Irish Catholic Church, Scottish actor-director Mullan clearly has an investment in the subject matter, injecting a gripping sense of urgency that sets ""Girls"" apart from other social-issue films. Striking performances from all four lead actors and Mullan's careful, sympathetic attention to the daily strife that affects these young girls may not leaven the dour tone, but they do give his harrowing drama a sense of outraged humanitarianism.

Wright captured the heart and soul of the designer-clad,thick-accented Dominican Republican and made him come alive in a way that brought a sharp pang of homesickness to this Bronx-bred sister. As I listened to Wright speak and witnessed his swaggering machismo I could hardly believe he was American born. This film was decent and sometimes even surprising but Peoples definitely proved himself the 'star'. Busta Rhymes injected a strong note of hilarity and Vanessa Williams was very believable in her role as a street cop (no sign of glamour). Samuel L. Jackson was a good-looking Shaft but came across as a little too volatile.

Along with the bright new treatments of old Christmas favorites such as Deck the Halls, Jingle Bells, and Sleigh Ride, the girls deliver some smooth new sounds in songs like That's What I Want for Christmas,and Tinsletown. Then, they join Rascal Flatts in Twist of the Magi, my very favorite offbeat but beautifully-set piece from the mix.

I was introduced to the techniques during one of my clicical affiliations as a student. I can honestly say that there have been very few patients that I have treated that have not been able to find relief with this technique. ""Treat Your Own Back"" is a wonderful resource that I issue to the majority of my patients in conjunction with their treatment and home exercise program. The book includes a basic, but thorough review of spinal anatomy. Also has very easy to understand text accompanied by pictures explaining the text. I highly recommend this book; however, if one does not achieve relief with this technique, or if thier symptoms increase or travel to another area, it is crucial that they consult with their physician and/or physical therapist.

Embargo the flow of foreign money into the country, money which is used to hire armies of people with no other work available to them. The Afghan people themselves are sick of war. Beautifully written, this book gives an insight into the people of Afghanistan you won't find anywhere else, a culture where a starving peasant will invite a stranger into their home to enjoy their last scrap of food.

224570,"An exciting and surprising story: From the two ""Doctor Who"" books by Christopher Bulis that I have read, it seems that he is very fond of astonishing plot twists. This book contains at least four major twists that I can remember, each of them a real humdinger. It also comtains a superb characterization of the Sixth Doctor and a decent one of Peri, interesting and believable supporting characters, and a fascinating plot (concerning what appears to be a parallel version of Roman history) that manages to be educational for readers despite not literally presenting real history. Then there is the surprise old enemy: the reader gets enough clues to figure out who it is in advance, so that the revelation of the enemy's identity is a truly thrilling moment since the reader finds that his or her guess is confirmed. I highly recommend this book.

But for no known reason, the paddle stopped turning. Motor goes on, but does not paddle. I attempted to contact the company several times for repair recommendations, and never got through anywhere. Email sent to the address in the manual drew ZERO response. I'm very disappointed; I now have a $300 paperweight. One of the main reasons I chose Lello was due to the other review saying the customer service was so good;apparently it's changed. I will not be purchasing from them again.

68326,"Crunchy coffee!: Melitta Mill & Brew Coffee Maker works well and is easy to clean but it does have some problems. You will typically use more coffee than you'd think to get a good cup. If you lose power for an instant, you have to reset the clock. The auto-shutoff is only an hour. But the biggest problem is that coffee grinds end up in the pot. This problem was negligible when I first got it but now I'm getting a lot of grinds and the coffee is almost undrinkable. I've only had it for 6 months and only used it about 50 times. Melitta said to buy another grinder but that's...for 50 more pots of coffee. A bit expensive.I liked this model because it is small and didn't appear as cumbersome as most of the grind and brew models are. It does pour a lot better than my old coffee pot; quicker with no spilling.

It was too long & too predictable. If you've read all or most of Robin Cook's novels as I have, you'll know what I mean. He has written too many novels where the managed care, insurance companies, or else the pharmaceutical companies are the bad guys. It's time for some new subject matter. I also had a hard time believing that a medical examiner could figure out that there was a serial killer on the loose after only doing two victim's autopsies and seeing that there was a pattern. I love the early Robin Cook novels, and everytime a new one comes out I buy it hoping that his writing has gotten back to like it used to be, and then I'm disappointed that it's not. Maybe in the future I need to just save my money.

SPR is NOT about Americans alone, but about courage and that there have been magnificient sacrifices made for our freedoms made. Thank you Mr. Spielberg for making this movie.

I even had it recommended to me by a girlfriend. A crazy one. Like bi-polar, put my dog to sleep crazy. She was a sad mistake, but this book was not. I'm a big David Lynch fan, and this book is kind of the novelization form of a movie I could see him putting out. Strange characters, some malevolent, some vacuous, all marching to the beat of their own eccentric drum. Things go from strange, to even stranger, with mixes of everything from mutations to lobotomies thrown in, yet it all makes sense, in a sort of bizarre and twisted fashion. It eventually concludes as a weird, off the beaten path, but completely original tale. In my book, those are the best ones.

He keeps most of the best bits, but he takes out Belle's marriage and most of Fred's party, which misses one of the central messages of the novelette: the importance of family, and the rewards of familial responsibility. It is important that Scroge has given up family in favor of money, and by cutting these scenes, we're left with a more generalized (and therefore less personal or intense) notion of social responsibility. BUt the performance is brilliant.

Suffice it to say that Lawford did drugs but as far as a ""true depiction"" of harrowing drug use it falls hugely short. Additionally, he speaks of his close relationship with his cousin David who dies but there is no real in depth or emotionally revealing description of how this really affected him. His story is interesting enough but it's a surface tale with a few anecdotes thrown in. The bits about the Kennedys and the Lawfords were the most interesting and it's too bad he couldn't have really looked inward and given us a great read. A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is a much better depiction of abuse and recovery. This ""bio"" leaves much to be desired.

I am a major grunge/rock fan and I am yet to find anyone who can come close to matching Laynes vocal range aside from other grunge legends like Eddie Vedder or Chris Cornell. AIC music was great alone and Staley's vocal range was what created that mixture into something that I and many others love. Its just sad when you here someone else try to redo what AIC did. The music is exactly the same with a few minor twists but i found the vocals lacked the emotion and other things that made AIC great. Personally I would much rather spend money on the original AIC albums or wait for Jerry Cantrell and Mike Inez to make one that can truly captivate what Layne Staley did.

Helene's run-away from Edouard and subsequent marriage to Lewis made absolutely no sense. Most of the characters are unrealistic and come from La-La Land. Thad's relationship with Lewis from the very beginning was farcical. As a matter of fact most of the characters were reminiscent of a fantasy or a nightmare.

I have an older non progressive scan Sony DVD player (about 6 yrs. old, when they were still $400) and it makes the picture jump out at you. I would go as far and say it is close to HD, depending on the movie. And the other components (HD cable box, XBOX) also show marked improvement. Its strength lies with the deinterlacing and scaling. If you have an older 16:9 monitor that makes your picture look distorted when you watch certain programming i.e. streching or can't see the news ticker, then try an iScan, the image will retain its natural symmetry no matter what the original aspect ratio was on the program.It won't work miracles, so don't expect it to turn all your sources into HD resolution.

The manuals and documentation all seemed to assume that the modem would be automatically detected, so they were not helpful in my case. I tried contacting tech support via their web page and while their site loaded fine, that page timed out. I tried calling tech support and received a message stating, ""We're sorry, we can't take your call right now.""It seems that plenty of people have had good experiences with this modem, but I feel burned not so much by the fact that it didn't work out of the box, but that support for the product is woefully lacking.

The puppy was thrilled and loved it in there and had plenty of room to play.Once it finished that use, it became a gate on our patio to keep the animals from getting their heads through the slats and getting stuck.Since then we've used it to keep the kids away from the Christmas tree, and various other things.A big hit is dumping a bunch of the little plastic balls in it and they love to play in there with them and the balls don't get all over the house (except for the occassional one throw out by hyper kids).We loved how easy it is to change the shape, making it fit in corners, around objects such as Christmas trees, and much more.We love it!

This is Jonathin showing his 80's MTV influence with all the Synth and Duran Duran style bands he must have loved because I hear it in him.Where's the ""sick"" ""Non Human"" drumming from the great Terry Bozzio? My personal opinion is that he played a few things but probably wasn't impressed with these tracks and passed. This album is going to tank, i'll be surprised if they recover from this. One things clear to most Korn fans is Head was the true writer for the band that gave them their heavy sound while munky strummed on what he was told.

It is important to know that you should not install Mouseworks on any PC running Microsoft Windows Vista or Windows 7. Mouseworks was exclusively developed to run under Windows XP and earlier versions of Windows. The Control Panel for Vista and Windows 7 does incorporate some options for input device configuration such as pointer speed adjustment, scrolling speed, and left/right button switch, however Mouseworks functionality such as button programming, fine tuning of acceleration et cetera are not supported.

I believe the advertised lower temperature limit is something like -4 degrees F, which is not very useful in much of the Northern US during the winter. The scale does appear to go a bit lower but the accuracy is very questionable. Several nights this winter (in central vermont) have caused the device to go off scale which then appears to set the minimum temperature to LL-L. The humidity sensor also seems to have a lower limit of 20% and it is unclear what the accuracy is near that limit.The external sensor does not have a button to turn of the display and conserve batteries nor does it have humidity sensor, which would be useful.The clock seems to work well.

As other reviews have stated, they are very stiff at least before the first wash. I have worn them a few times now and they have loosened up. As others have stated, order a size larger. While they fit, they were a little tight especially through the hip area which was surprising. The only other complaint would be the pockets do not have as much room as other pants in the front. The side pocket about knee level is probably good for sunglasses and a nice touch. I use it for my keys since I don't have enough room in the front pockets. All in all, these pants are great. I purchased them for work at the bank and they look great and didn't wrinkle in the washer and dryer. A huge plus for men! I will be purchasing more in a larger size.

I picked this up because it had Love Like Blood ( which I think is just gorgeous ) and it had an overview on their material from 1979-1990. I have not been disappointed with this release as it has made me buy even more of their material if and when I can. It's interesting to note that the cover was one of the first flyers the band had used for a gig and caused a lot of controversy for what you see on the cover ( A priest giving the Nazis his blessing ) that the organizer refused to let them play at the venue!Overall a very good introduction to Killing Joke but I do find the last track to be somewhat out of place with the rest of them.

To these problems he presents basic theological arguments to the effect of a reminder of Christ's command ""love thy neighbor.""But what is most helpful about the book is the way he provides a framework for the goal of Catholic Social teaching. He proposes a few negative arguments for what it is not, as well as a few positive arguments to clarify what it does.For quite some time I've been curios about how to apply Catholic Social teaching as a layman and this book has helped me immensely with that curiosity.

Romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them. Obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film.For this viewer the 'parody' eludes. LAND OF THE DEAD is simply a dark, grotesque, poorly written, hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre. But how fine actors like Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Asia Argento, and Robert Joy agree to the casting agent's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum. Grady Harp, December 06

This film totally destroys Stanley Kubrick's vision in one fell swoop. It is the exact opposite of what Kubrick presented to the viewer in every respect. Uninspired sequels have a way of diminishing the impact of the original. Luckily ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"" still stands the test of time and remains unblemished by this inept sequel.

When we then got together for our monthly meeting to discuss the book, our meeting quickly turned into a meeting of laughter and unbelief. How in the world did Miss Willig get this book published? Unfortunately, we all agreed that it is by far, the worst book any one of us has ever read. Between the 'zaps' and 'thumps' and so on, we were not sure if we were reading a cartoon. The vocabulary is not of the times, and the manner of writing is not only boring, but it detracts from a story which perhaps has potential. Between the 12 of us in the book club, we might have read the whole book. Our suggestion is, please don't write the next book!

Well, I hate to break it to you, but the series isn't that original or groundbreaking. Many old anime genres and plots are copied and the series itself never really progresses anywhere at all... the characters are barely delved into w/ any depth and as the series goes on the stories get thinner and thinner. The best episode by far is the first, having some pretty cool action scenes, but after that what little action there is is pretty lame. The best character in the series is a quirky little hacker genius named Ed. The episodes w/ Ed are worth watching.What probably most soured me on the series is the unbelievably lame ending. The cheese oozing out of the last few episodes actually angered me more than entertained. I tried to forget as quickly as possible what I had just seen, it was so stupid.

Shia Lebouf (Bobby) stars as a young man in search of his first car. He stumbles across an aging 70s Camaro that is far more than it seems.

The first tape is the best. Daniel Radcliffe does a wonderful job playing young David. The plot also follows the book and even the lines in the book very well. The character are cast perfectly. Mr. Murdstone is horrible, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber are exactly how they are in the book! In the second tape, I wish they hadn't cut out the part with the old Doctor, or Tommy Traddles. They focused more on his relationship with Dora and Agnes in the movie, whereas there are many themes going on at once in the book. Also some little things, like Agnes doesn't seem to take quite so kindly to Dora in the movie as she does in the book. But Maggie Smith is excellent as Betsy Trotwood (of course). Overall, this is a fabulous movie. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll want to after you see this.

Definitely get the blu-ray version if you have a blu-ray player but I'm sure the regular DVD looks fine too since they are both from the same recent restoration and transfer. The only extra on the single disc blu-ray is a new one hour documentary on the making of the film. It's very good and in high definition too.

While there are some cleverly written stories with a lot of irony and dark humor, the stories lack depth and consistency. The stories did not touch me or affect me in any way, which is what I look for in literary short fiction. Instead, I was either bored or disgusted with the banality of some of the stories. But, as I said earlier, there are some good ones. I enjoyed ""How to be a Writer,"" ""How to Be an Other Woman,"" ""Amahl and the Night Visitors.""

I probably would not have bought this case if I had examined it in a store, but for under $30 I wasn't going to bother returning it to the on-line vendor.

If you have, or if you have a good knowledge of Japanese monster myths, you will enjoy this film.The story is not going to blow you away, but at least it is coherent and something you can follow, which is good for this sort of anime to live action genre. It's also important to note that the TV anime rarely took itself seriously and was a kind of corny, creepy horror anime for kids. That said, I'm certain many adults who grew up on it found guilty pleasure in watching this movie translation.It looks great on blu-ray and a couple of scenes stand out - in particular the flames on the wheels of a train in one scene, a fox spirit's tail hairs, and dad eyeball in a basket on a river.All in all, a colorful, fun movie, but don't expect anything serious -- you'll find the end credits top off the mood of the whole movie...!

The PM video is really my favorite. I sit all day at the office and this video has some truly wonderful stretches that leave my aching body feeling relaxed as well as strong! I recommed this video for anyone - probably intermediate level and above - who needs something quick and effective in the morning and something effective yet relaxing in the evening. I also liked the PM yoga moves a lot more than the straight up yoga videos (I don't have enough balance for those). The PM yoga stretches are a nice intro to yoga, so you might also consider this video, if you are thinking about trying yoga.

It works so well I am even considering buying one for my girlfriend's house even though my cat is only over there about 3 days out of the month. You are paying for a great idea, but the quality could be a little better. I imagine later models of this litter box will only get better, but I definitely recommend this one to anyone who is sick of scooping.

As a matter of fact, I think she put more energy into dressing up than she did into the covers. As a Depeche Mode fan, her ""interpretation"" of Enjoy the Silence was an insult. She could have gone so many places with it (I know she could of, check out her cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"") but didn't. New Age and Heart of Gold are PAINFULL to listen to. Real Men is the only song that is remotely palatable. Too bad it didn't last longer.

The situation in which the plot occurs is also very believeable, even though it came from the mind of the author.This is a nice little suspense novel. It has all the right stuff: romance, mystery, and murder. The book also has a lot of history to it. A nice read.

44358,"Lacks depth and emotion, highly over-rated.: Jay-Z has no depth in his rappin'. All his songs are about how much ice he has, cars, groupies, and other shallow concepts. Not only that, all his songs sound the same, have the same boring feel to them. I wonder if the leading age in buying Jay-Z records is in the ninety-year-old senior citizens category. His lyrics were at one time good but he's totally fallen off since his second album. The track with Snoop, ""Get Your Mind Right Mami"" could've been a lot better, it wasn't very impressive, mediocre at BEST. And it was the best song on the CD. Let me tell you, if Jay-Z is the leader in today's commercial hip-hop world, we're in a lot of trouble. I don't like hearing about Kurupt and Daz doing a song with him either. I admit ""Change The Game"" remix with Kurupt and Daz was good but they don't need Jay-Z to sell records. Stay Away From This.

In any event, I, unhappy in my present career, was looking for a book that would inspire me to make a change. Don't be deceived, this is not a self-help book. The stories of the individuals in the book are half-baked, uninspiring and in certain instances go unresolved. There are no useful insights or ""gems"" to be taken and used in our personal lives. The writing by Po (or editing by his publisher) is disjointed and confusing. I could only get through about three-quarters of this drivel before putting it down.

The true incident from 1928 is dramatic and inspiring and should have made an excellent script.The characters are appallingly weak almost as though the period costumes and set were a distraction! Angelina is hugely disappointing as one may expect but John Malkovich? Clearly the director has failed. The screenplay is a whole disappointment unto itself and not just because its predictable in a school play sort of way. If the Academy had to award bad performances, this movie would sweep a dozen. This movie also features the worst portrayal of a police captain in the history of film (again, clearly the director's failure.) The narration of the gruesome slaughter of mere children is so terrible, its actually not disturbing!Worst of all, it runs about 2.5 hours. What a waste!

What's the point of writing if you have nothing to say? An author cannot worry about whether or not the reader is ready for messages presented.

His novels are consistently head and shoulders above the majority of the SF drek that's published, yet his books continue to languish as first-run paperbacks.'Hunted' is an excellent addition to Gardner's Future Earth storyline. The story is crisp and exciting from page 1 to the back cover. I have not yet been disappointed by a Gardner book. If you haven't read this (relatively) new author yet, don't waste another minute. It's difficult to judge an author based on four books, but for my money James Alan Gardner is one of the most consistently entertaining authors in SF today.

In fact, this bag is probably large enough to fit another smaller tent alongside this one.The thin nylon construction of the bag does concern me a bit, but until I do several field tests where the bag gets beat up a little, I won't know. Until then, though, this bag is more than large enough to replace original manufacturer's bag.Update 6/29: The bag survived a trip. It dries quickly. The construction of the bag and the zipper still don't strike me as being reliable in the long-term, but it made it through being packed in an army duffle over several portages and loading/unloading on a canoe.

On the other hand, if you have plenty of time, and want to take it to savor the good of either ruby or rails or their interconnects, maybe it is the right book.

So if you look carefully on the front right side of the male slot, you'll see it's about 1/8"" narrower than the left side. This is how it gets one side tighter than the other. One side slides in easily and eventually gets tighter as the male part gets increasingly wider. 2) Pay particular attention to making sure your M and F pieces align on the left side and that your boards are the same width. This important for achieving the tight fit at the other end of your boards. (I first did a test cut using 2 different widths of boards, and they didn't fit, and I freaked...at first)I agree with other writers that the whole OmniJig could use a major upgrade, putting precision adjustment knobs instead of trial and error stop blocks for example, would really help....Tom O'Brien...All Quality Woodworking

She really, really didn't want Viola as a boarder, either, but Viola became a co-conspirator in investigating Aylwin.For me, one of the tests of a good book is wondering what might happen afterwards to the characters. Will Viola's husband-to-be be sorry he married someone who can't cook & is a sloppy housekeeper? Will Dulcie be able to forget that Aylwin was interested in her niece? and so on

It's principle problems are (1) a keyboard which requires tremendous effort to punch the keys and (2) the printing on the calculator is tiny and almost unreadable, (3) the tiny enter key. I think the person who designed the interface on this calculator never used an HP calculator before. These things alone make it a nightmare to use. This calculator was given to me by my dad, who didn't like it either. I bought a 48GX instead; the 48GX is not as fast, and has fewer bells & whistles but is traditional HP -- big enter key, buttons that have a positive click, easy to read printing on the calculator. I use HP calculators exclusively because of the RPN entry; once you become accustomed to it you realize how clunky and error-causing the algebriac system entry system is. But HP has other RPN machines -- buy one of those.

He has in Mark 14:58Kataloo-o ""Throw down""In Mark 15:29 dealing with the same word and topic ""destroying the temple"" he has for Kataloo-o (one razing, not sure where this word came from) and in acts 6:14 Kataloo-o ""destroy"" this is greatly confusing and apparent throughout the book.A much better more consistent would be George Ricker Berry's interlinear at least he uses the king James English and the Greek text.

Fitzgerald puts across some good points, but the book left me without the feeling of having been there and only with images of what happened. He did not do a very good job of emphasizing the important points, and I'm afraid I missed some of them. I would only recommend this book if your intent is a long-term study of writers of the 20th century.

270511,"Great setting, but more detail needed: This is the most creative setting that TSR is still printing (as Spelljammer has been defunct for years now). It is a good way to introduce lower-level adventurers to the Outer Planes without plunking them into the middle of the Abyss. The descriptions of the factions, Sigil, and the Outlands are very well done. My only problem with the setting was the lack of detail on the various Inner and Outer Planes. If you're looking for chapter-by-chapter descriptions of the planes and their inhabitants, this setting is not for you - each plane gets a half-page to a page of description, leaving the in-depth coverage to the Monstrous Compendiums and the expansions to the setting. Still, if you plan to run a campaign completely based in the Outer Planes, this setting is a must.

197158,"Intrigue at the Vatican: Fast-paced action that has very few lapses of momentum throughout. In many ways this type of story will be familiar to Robert Ludlum fans but without the often cumbersome plot twists that slows down Ludlum's weaker efforts.The characterization within Day of Confession could be a bit stronger but the plot allows it all to work. The idea of a successful, innocent man being pulled into a web of suspense and treachery is a tried and true formula. In this novel, however, it works better than in many others.I have read a great deal of this type of international intrigue fiction and find that this one is one of the best, rivaling The Materese Circle for overall satisfaction.

The anemometer feature is totally inaccurate, I've never seen it read higher than 8 mph even when we're getting 40 mph wind gusts. The internal house temperature is consistently 3 degrees lower than the actual temperature in the house. The most irritating aspect is the lack of backlighting which makes it very difficult to read. The outside wind and temperature sensors randomly loose their signal for no apparent reason, even with brand new lithium batteries. I primarily bought the unit because it featured an anemometer, but the anemometer is useless and not even close to reality in its readings. I would not buy this unit again.

The novel lays out in very gripping, compelling fashion the hypocrisy and arrogance, self-righteousness and materialism that is rampant in many religious organizations today. Because it is so open and honest, and told with such power and conviction, you find it hard sometimes to believe it's fiction. Highly suspenseful and often terrifying, the story is surprisingly upbeat in the end, with some really astounding twists I never anticipated. No doubt, this will prove to be a controversial novel, but it's a controversy that is long overdue and badly in need of the exposure this worthy novel gives it. A terrific tale, well told!

This is the best guarantee against a drive failure: when a drive fails, you won't lose a byte of information. I've been doing this for years, and never looked back.

166891,"Great intentions, terrible in reality: At first I thought this unit was great. The setup was pretty intuitive and it'd handle exactly the programming that I needed. I setup my appliance on this expecting to find it turned off 3 hours later. To my shock and horror, I found the device on 10 hours later with the timer displaying all 8888 for the time, as well as every other LCD element lit. Unplugging and replugging did not fix anything, and actually proved it was further broken! The battery backed-up clock/timer feature was also not working (although it was working great out of the box, and as I setup the unit). Now something is rattling around inside the unit and its display is still just full of garbage as it passes power (a *SAFE* unit would fail to OFF, not ON). The quality control is certainly not up to par. My appliance was rated at a quarter of the capacity of this 15A unit, I should not have had problems! Avoid!!

147004,"Looks better, but not durable: I bought this pitcher because it looks a little better than the standard ones. Unfortunately it has some durability problems that are common to Brita pitchers and also some of its own.1) The first thing that broke was the little plastic hinge like things that hold the large lid on. This has broken on every Brita I've owned and I don't understand why they don't make it more durable-well, I guess they sell more this way.2) The ""chrome"" finish on the underside of the lid has started to peel off. This is disturbing and I am concerned about this stuff falling into the water.3) The front pouring hinge seems to freeze in the 'frig sometimes-which is weird because I think it is plastic. The result is that water runs out the sides (and usually onto the table) instead of into the glass.Like I mentioned, it initially looked better than the other Britas, but I'm tired of them breaking and so I will get a different brand next time.

The curious anomaly of the German Women's Auxiliary Services during the Second World War"" (available as a Kindle ebook) which concentrates on the servicewomen, their work and organisation.

The historical period that Mr. Furst's novels treat -- the thirties and forties, the rise of nazi Germany, and the descent of Europe into war -- has always fascinated me. His historically accurate novels bring alive this period. If you're a history buff with an interest in this area, and if you like a good spy story, then Alan Furst is a real find. I can even tolerate an occasional plot slowdown or belief-suspending coincidence, as long as his stories weave their way through real historical events and people. His stories have sharpened my understanding of the events in eastern Europe during the pre-war and early war years. So far, Mr Furst is batting a thousand with me.

249908,"Wonderful!! SMALL SPOILER!: WOW!! I have just finished this book and the first thing that comes to my mind is WOW!!! It was great! The characters were strong, and the plot was full of twists. There are only two reasons why this book got only four stars from me. The first and probably the biggest is Chance and Fancy's relationship. They had great chemistry, but their constant sniping at each other got a little old. And two, I was really dissapointed when Gil was killed. I would have loved to read a book about him. He was easy to love. Overall I'd say this was one of the better books, by far! I strongly reccomend it!!!

I on the other hand read it in two toilet sittings, as it is shorter than most of my monthly magazines, and found it pretty lame, lame jokes, and not educational in any way, shape, or form. Even if he did read it, he would have been no better off in helping me through this pregnancy. what a waste of money.

Users will find that the earbuds' conical-shape, combined with the rubber covers (you can't use the earbuds without these covers, because the metal will scratch your inner ear), allows these earbuds to constantly slip out of your ears. During a 30-minute walk, at least one of the buds (most often the left one, because of the asymmetric cabling system) must have slipped out of my ear every half-block. And the problem isn't just limited to wearing them during a workout, because they even slipped out of my ears while I was sitting at my desk. These are definitely going back to the store.

I was a little apprehensive wondering if we would end up with a CD full of ""A moment like this"" songs or not (not that I'm knocking that song either cause I liked it too). Kelly has an amazing vocal range and an ability to real you into her songs and style. Although the CD does jump around from Pop, to Blues to some R&B sounds, it is very tastefully done and the songs are awesome. I think they could have laid off the instrumental some and let her golden voice shine through more but I've listened to it from beginning to end and was not disappointed.Kelly is a very talented young woman and I'm glad to see her Freshman album be such a success. Shame on the Dallas radio station who said they couldn't stand ""Miss Independent"" because it wasn't ""Kelly's"" style...

I cant believe he put them in the list and not Dre, eminem, B-real and other such rappers. Im guessin he didn't put in some good underground rappers because they didn't make it big in the game. I personally think krs is the best MC but i can see why he didn't make it to #1 (u gotta look at the stats and how he rates it to understand why, so look at that b4 u start to disagree).

This is one step better than the old school beeping out of the cusswords, but if you are going to take the time to edit the vocals out and actually press up an alternative version to your release, take the time and put in alternative vocals, so it flows and plays like an actual song not all butchered up.

These stories are so well written that you feel you are actualy in the ancient mythical world of hyboria. The illustrations within the book are a beautifull compliment to each story. I just wish the stories were longer since i am used to reading the full length novels but, most people like short stories so if you like action packed stories in faraway exotic places you will love this collection.

Of course they think it is fun to go in a bag. Especially the little boy since they like to go anywhere once they are trained. They love to show off. They are funny. This is an unusual product.I will probably buy more for my other great grand children.

Who wants to pay a lot of money for something designed to cook only one thing?Don't waste your money on this. Spend the extra money on something better.I have this and boils over and the measurements on the cup that it gives is off. You can only cook white rice, and you have to pay a lot of attention while it cooks, because it will start to bubble and the lid will crack and you have terrible rice.it cooks vegetables as well, and i've found that useful. It's a nice feature, but it doesn't redeem it at all.i mainly use it to steam dumplings now.

I got it as a shower gift. It is so easy to get my daughter in and out of the car. The straps don't tangle because of the velcro on the sides to hold them in place. What a clever idea! However, I didn't install this myself. I went to a car dealership who was certified to install carseats. They anchored the tether strap to the bottom bar of the front seat since she is till rear-facing. The seat is so secure and does not move. I highly recommend going to have it installed just for peace of mind. I did that with her infant base as well. She looks so comfortable even when she sleeps. Greatest carseat!! I highly recommend it!!

Bison (Neal McDonough). And that's pretty much the one thing director Andrzej Bartkowiak gets right.The mismatched cast play their stereotypical action movie roles to their hilt, the script has more holes than Bonnie and Clyde's car, and the movie crew simply didn't consider the ramifications of taking a video game story this seriously. The first SF film was silly and over the top, but that's where you found a hint of charm. What does this entry offer? Pretty locales, a so-so fight choreography, the mandatory movie explosion, and Chun Li seductively dancing with another woman. OK, that's two things Bartkowiak gets right.^_^This film is PG-13: Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations.

153191,"Re: the reviews following my original.: I already explained why I didn't like the book. True crime books are supposed to have a detailed description of the crime, all the clues, leads, and tips that lead up to the arrest of the suspect(s). 23 Days of Terror was more of an homage to the victims than anything; and in all honesty, I find that boring. If you want to see what a good true crime book should be like, read The Brown's Chicken Massacre by Maurice Posley. Every detail as to how the police caught the two murderers is written, and Posley still manages to show the respect for the victims, but it's not boring like this one was. As to your distaste for my closing line: excuse me if you can't take a joke. You act as if you live in the only city that has ever had a serial killer. Just because your city's tragedy happened to be on CNN doesn't make you Yoda.

He also promised me a refund, but the check never showed up. He claimed to be a disabled 80 year old man, I'm sure that's a load of crap too. Take my advice and don't buy anything from this guy.

(Big mistake) It warped, the seal failed allowing moisture to leak, the rice caught on fire, part of the cooker melted, the house was filled with smoke, and I don't know if I will ever get rid of the stench. I wouldn't allow another one of those things in the house if Joyce Chen personally brought it to the door and begged me to take it. )-8

133940,"Waste of money - doesn't work as advertised: This is a complete waste of money. If I could give it less than one star, I would. It took forever to inflate (best to have an air pump handy). Once assembled, the slide portion kept tipping over. The directions have you add water to two small pillows under the slide portion. 1) The plugs don't stay in when you have the water in the pillows 2) It is not enough water to make the slide stable. When the hose is hooked to the slide to squirt water, the additional weight of the hose also tips the slide over. For my kids to play with this (5 and 8 years), I had to stand next to the slide holding it upright. Complete waste of money!

The paper guide actually makes it even more difficult to feed letter-size paper. Previous models were cleanable if you weren't afraid to open up the case - for the XP300, only one of the sensors is accessible. After a while the other one will gunge up; good luck cleaning it.

41642,"A Book That Reaffirms My Faith In Shortstories: The modern shortstory, let's face it, is a dying artform. Yes, there are journals and literary magazines dedicated to publishing them but unless the words ""Ellery Queen"" or ""Isaac Asimov"" appear on the cover odds are you won't find them on your average magazine stand. It is even more deplorable in bookstores. It is rare to see a collection of shortstories from anyone to whom the phrase ""best selling author"" applies to. So I find it great that every once in a while Jeffrey Archer serves up a new set of clever yarns. He's published several but this one is the best. The tales are written well and are good entertainment on their own face but he goes the extra mile by pulling surprises in the end. And I do mean the end. Frequently in this set the line that opens your eyes is the final one. Running the gamut from the fairly amusing ""The Steal"" to the tragic ""Christina Rosenthal"" there is, if nothing else, something for everyone. Absolutely first rate.

It's darker undertones, serious themes, and adult story lines made it so much more real than any of the other treks. It's story arcs are really what sold me though, unlike other treks, this series doesn't just push the reset button after every episode. Actions have consequences in this show, just like in real life. The packaging isn't the best though, but Paramounts packaging never has impressed me. That's really the only reason I gave this product 4 instead of 5 is the packaging.

The second, ""Der Fledermaus Technologik"" is more tender: a love story set in the Ghettoes of Rome that gives vent to Hasselhoff's grim melodrama. As the song reaches its apex, you start to wonder who it is that Hasselhoff keeps calling ""mein spunkchiefer"".After such a serious opening, one is surprised and delighted to hear the mood give way in the middle of the album to a series of operatic follies and early house like the Cookie Crew. Hasselhoff starts to have fun and its much better.Unfortunately the last two songs ""Jagermeister Fluids"" and ""Das Butt"" revert to the ""old jakey"" style. ...It makes for a weeping sore of a finale when it should have been cakes and fireworks. ...

266839,"Starring Deanna Durbin: The Amazing Mrs. Holliday is the story of an American girl (Deanna Durbin) who brings children out of China during World War II. On the ship to America, a wealthy man tells her he will adopt all nine children because he lives in a large house with plenty of room. However, the ship is torpedoed and the man does not survive. In desperation, the girl tells his family that she is his widow and she begins living in the house with the children. In the meantime, she takes a liking to her grandson-in-law (Edmond O'Brien).Durbin carries her part with her usual charm and with the maturity of her later years in Hollywood. O'Brien is adequate in his part but is outshined by his female co-star.One of the best scenes in the film is a silent one at a dinner table. It utilizes all the greatness of the Hollywood gone by.The end of the film seems to fizzle, but it is brought back to life by an unexpected twist.

The ballads are moving and melifluous; the rock-n-roll is out of this world! I'm glad that the Irish theme was put back into the music. Irish is a great song, but my favorite is Take Me As I Am. A song that reminds me of convincing a girl she should be with me and why it would make me more complete. Head On Straight is a moving and gut wrenching song about relationship mistakes and ameliorating promises. Finishing the top three is Liar. This rocking song reminds me that I am who I am and no one will ever be able to change that with malice and lies. Tonic fans--rush out now and buy this CD. No Tonic collection, or music collection, is complete without this CD!

The author is a devoted Serbophile mixing historical half-truths and half-fictions always to the elevation of the Serbs among other balkan nations. The result is that nothing in this book can be trusted for any historical value and in the long term it backfires on many fronts as history has recently proven. In the end this book can only bee seen as an exposition of the views and ideas of the author herself rather then the people that she's describing. As a conclusion this book doesn't serve anybody's purpose as a historical/travel account book, but would certainly be much better suited to the 'Fiction' section of the library where it would be appreciated for what it is, a fiction/propaganda book.

He and Autum Reeser have very little on-screen chemistry, yet we are to believe that she falls for him. The plot is incredibly predictable and unoriginal. The film fails to make you care about any of the characters. The production values are good, and the acting is decent, but the story is not at all engaging. In short, there is a good reason this one went straight to video - it's completely lackluster. Do yourself a favor and pass on this film...

The first book at least easily beats most of the modern fantasy. Or is it fantasy at all? I suppose this is what they call a Great American Novel, even though magic works and George Washington gets executed. Card's way of handling religion and metaphysics is really fascinating. The reason I don't give the book 5 stars is that there are some minor faults. Maybe the uncriticizing praise of ol' American virtues is the most significant one. Still a good read, and I'm now heading for the rest of the series.P.S. My favourite poet William Blake makes a surprising appearance in the book, as one of its main characters. Thumbs up for that!

I don't know if the makers of this movie thought that saying that it was a true story would make it sell better or if they just didn't do ANY research into who Hopkins was.

As usual, Capcom presented some excellent sprites and rich backgrounds. The music in this game, however, is a cut above the typical sound track of the time. The game play is similar to the MegaMan series, with bosses providing new powers that can then be used to great effect against other bosses. Several of these powers are also accompanied by control and gameplay changes - i.e. the ability to dash, improved flight, or swimming. It was a refreshing twist on what had, at the time, become a tired formula.

It just seemed more of the same.Lisa See prefaced the history of her family would often have to be told via bits and pieces and facts that were not always clear.Therefore, I found it difficult to accept her blow by blow narration in detail, detail, detail, and quotes from family members long gone.Had the book been much shorter, not weighed down with so much uninteresting descriptives, it would have been more a page turner.What bothered me most is that I really did not find myself engrossed in any of the characters.

I only managed to force myself to watch 35 minutes of this movie before realising, it didn't get any better and my time was more valuable than spending it watching this trash.Briefly, it's a *very* low budget horror flick. Some people are out in a section of a forest (which for some reason, doesn't show up on maps of the area), and they run into a ""big-foot"" type monster. It mauls people, they die (and amazingly, while being ripped apart, there are no screams from the actors, just splashes of fake blood onto the camera lens).The acting is wooden. The camera work is attrocious (including a lot of steady shots of people which suddenly change to zoom in and then zoom outs). The storyline is nothing new.I couldn't put in more time watching this. It may have improved after the 35 minute mark, but frankly, I no longer cared.There are a *lot* of low budget movies out there that are much better than this.

Their version of Clapton's ""Wonderful Tonight"", all three Billy Marlowe songs and particularly ""Bonaparte's Retreat"" and ""Taxman"" are extremely well done. They all remind me of the raw, earthy but accomplished output that you could find in many of the pubs and clubs that I used to frequent.

It was very difficult to get it tight enough by hand, and eventually that little leaf just twisted away. The whole assembly is ruined because of that little piece of garbage metal.

Only the title song, ""Dominique,"" hit the charts at #4, I believe, but every single song they recorded was divinely beautiful. The words, melodies, concepts, their wonderful voices - it was all like a dream.I experienced some trepidation before playing it when it first arrived, though. I thought, are my memories of those beautiful songs more lyrical than they actually were, in reality? But from the moment the music began, it all came rushing back to me - many passages in French, which was astounding - and I play it all the time now. Even my daughter, Grace, is walking around the house singing little snippets of these lovely songs praising God. The Singing Nun is a joyful album and if you want your spirits to rise, put it on and you'll see what I mean!Long live Belgium!

I sort of groaned at the length of the songs, some running 17 minutes, and thought this was probably another out-dated psych/ Dead-type jam record. Upon my first listen I was changed. The songs all have tons of character and narritives that are labourous and everything is surprisingly listenable, even with different sections and interludes and time signature changes, etc.I would recommend this to anyone searching for something truly original.

288875,"Nancy with the Lovely Voice: I always think of Nancy Sinatra as a special hidden treasure. The world knows her for all those hit records but most people have no idea what a technically excellent, rich-voiced, smartly interpretative singer she is. I've played this album for friends without identifying the singer. They say, ""The girl is terrific,"" then are totally surprised when I reveal they are hearing Nancy Sinatra. Invariably people think of the tough chick from the first hit records, music they love by a singer they love. But they have no idea she has a much wider musical picture in her history. This is a wonderful album start to finish with intriguing songs, beautiful arrangements and a singer who is first-rate by any measure.

What actually happened was me groaning a lot, and wondering just what the heck was supposed to be going on in this stinker, as I dozed off again and again. The plot is so threadbare that it's about as developed as an Power Rangers episode, and the martial arts are along the same caliber. The special effects are laughable at best (couldn't they do better than that rubber crocodile?) and the dubbing is just plain pathetic. I can't recommed this film to anyone, except people who enjoy suffering through absolute dreck. I would've given it no stars if it were possible.

277846,"The Big Letdown.: The subtitle overstates the significance of this book (A Scientific Discovery That Revolutionizes the Way We View the Origin of Life, the Water We Drink, etc). The Big Splash is very technical and , for those of us without a Doctorate in Geophysics it is quite a dry read. The references to the Space Program and the human elements that show the competition and back-stabbing that goes on in the scientific community are more interesting and help to move you to the end of the story, but, this is little solice for the feeling of being let down at the conclusion (or lack thereof) at the end of the book. Unfortunately, this book is probably the best you can find on the topic, though. I guess you cannot expect every scientific story to be a great read. If you need the data and answers to questions you can find in this book (like I did), you probably won't find it anywhere else. Grab a cup of strong coffee.

I photographed homecoming parades on gray days, portraits, wildlife, and nature. They all looked good. I had no underexposure issues, and my exposure speeds and aperture sizes were fairly well adjusted too. I think that in a field such as photography, this lens is just fine for people starting out or who don't have $1000 to $2000 for one lens.I'm not the greatest at figuring out the distances of lenses, but this one goes fairly far. Be warned though, when extended to 300 or so, the lens gets a tad long, and can be a little hard to hold steady. I don't use a tripod all that much, and none of my pictures were blurry from shake.

AND the kicker is that 40 of the 125 questions in the back are about FLORIDA and the guidelines there. ALSO - the questions are based on the 1988 version of Information Power... talking about overhead projectors and how many square feet there should be for certain calculations, etc.The book is a hoax and a waste of money.

247225,"Great Notebook, a few things to consider: Loved the notebook overall. I originally bought the notebook because I liked the idea of the tabs that I could use to organize it into sections. Where this fails is that when you tear out the labels (via the pre-perforated line) it leaves about 1/32 of a page which is of a higher gauge paper. This causes the notebook to have a hard time being held open at first. After that, it kind of becomes an annoyance for folding pages in half and putting them into the notebook like a folder. The Blueline advertisements and self-love write-ups on the inside get a little tiring as well. Also, any medium nib fountain pen users out there might be a little careful when purchasing this notebook. Using Noodler's Sequoia Green it is not possible to write on both sides of the page without making both sides unreadable. This is possible with AT Cross ballpoints and Pilot G2 07. Works great with both. Would highly recommend otherwise.

A disappointing movie.The production values were straight out of late 60s early 70s low budget American television: the hard contrast videotape appearing visuals; the harsh, hollow audio, sounding as if recorded in a big empty studio; clumsy superimposed images; the dated piano and cello underscore, and even the narrative structure reminded be of the Sunday morning dramas of faith which I watched occasionally in the early 70s. The production sensibilities landed so solidly in the style of low budget contemporary television drama of the early 70s that I simply could not convince myself that the movie took place at any other time despite the sets, costumes, and subject matter.The movie itself expressed and belabored its themes with the same subtlety as those Sunday morning television parables as well.

Be warned: The book is NOT a comprehensive catalog of uniforms and heraldry and will be of pretty limited use to the militaria collector. There are 40 b&w photos and eight color plates along with four tables describing orders of dress, ranks, and insignia. The photos are a mix of action shots and posed portraits. The 24 full-color uniforms depicted in the color plates are accompanied by text describing the uniform and the equipment worn by the soldiers.

230220,"Why? **CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS TOWARDS THE END**: What did we do to deserve this?? Is this retaliation for the whole Freedom Fries thing?? Seriously though. This film is awful. The ending surprise is given away in the first 10 minutes. The gore is over the top and poorly done. The film slips from English dubbed to French in the middle for about 20 minutes. Did you forget to voice over that part? Were you too busy trying to understand the movie yourself? Don't get me wrong, I understand the movie. It's a pretty shallow concept, that could've made for a good yarn if the idiots in charge of this thing would've put a little time and consideration into the continuity of the film. The whole premice of the movie is a giant plot hole.**SPOILERS AHEAD** I can handle poor effects and low budget if there's continuity, but this is just dumb. I've tried to make sense of it, even going out on limbs but it just doesn't work! Split personalities don't drive two vehicles simultaniously! BAH! STUPID!

It has to be durable because he has been packing all sorts of stuff in it. Thank you Targus! I also purchased the Messenger Bag for myself at the same time.

Southerners in the mid-19th century believed blacks were subhuman. This book asks you to believe that they would ignore their beliefs and treat blacks ""equally"" just because they had a change of heart.

It's definitely an upgrade. We have the 9980 model, which has an excellent digital answering machine and one line. The battery in the phone itself is a bit weak (If you forget to hang it up it dies). My favorite factor with all of the Uniden models is that they have a very tactile feel. When you push a button, you know it, no mush. It's the only brand on the market that seems to have that feel -- sort of the way nothing used to feel like an IBM keyboard, if you know what I mean. It's also a comfortable and lightweight phone, not too small like many phones nowadays (who wants a teensy phone that has a microphone two inches from your mouth?).All in all, I like it plenty, and it's also the top-rated cordless brand in Consumer Reports.Enjoy!

Never in my life have I heard anything so boring, and I listen to incredibly quiet and slow music. There is no soul whatsoever anywhere on this CD. The performances are as lackluster as possible. Norah Jones is a mediocre singer with no personality. I just can't, for the life of me, figure out how this is so popular.

The lights are very closely spaced (9 inches apart at the top, but light to light is only about 5 inches because the lights are square and fairly big-baseball size), and then you basically have an entire extension cord length left over. The lights are expensive, and if they were spaced apart appropriately, it would be a really nice set (not sure why they are spaced so closely since they are larger and have bigger bulbs than most standard ""string"" light sets).

I received it as a hand-me-down from somebody whose kid got it as a gift from the hospital. However, some details in this book are either exaggerated from reality or outdated, for instance today's floor puzzles are usually made of cardboard as opposed to wood so would probably disintegrate into tiny pieces in the stomach without requiring a trip to the hospital. And as far as I've studied, people still have barium(well, it's actually barium sulfate)before an x-ray of the digestive tract. And as far as I know, the x-ray machines have NEVER looked like laser guns. Almost everyone knows they look like cameras or picture frames. But the part when George mistakes the record player for a merry-go-round certainly has an outdated detail because records are not common anymore. I wonder if some of the procedures in this book were based on tonsil removal.Just don't purposely imitate George's antics.

So, the quality is really bad and the material is usless and I think this book needs a serious revision and after that it can be considered useful. Until then I don't recomend it.

255124,"Ok but fuzzi bunz were better: For our first child we wanted to use cloth diapers. Because the reviews were so vaied we decided to try both the swaddlebees and the fuzzi bunz. The swaddlebees weren't very good. First small didn't fit (our baby was over 8 lbs) then when they did fit they always leaked. Also, because it is an all-in-one diaper it takes ages to dry. You would need three full sets becuase they take an entire day to dry. For new parents looking to take the cloth diaper option I would recommend the fuzzi bunz cloth diapers, the adjustable fit means you can use them from day one and because of the pocket insert they dry quickly. Hope it helps.

It was a good track in 98 and I think would be Next's biggest track.And theres this - a fake ass attempt from some pretty british boys to become an R&B; group. Blues version of this song is nothing but an attempt by the record company to cash in on others material and success.They dont add anything to the song, making it sound almost identical to the original. Even the backing track sounds almost the same as the original.I completely dislike this version of the song and I passionately dislike this group and everything they come out with.

122603,"One of the finest boxed sets I've ever purchased!: Burt Bacharach was one of those songwriting talents you usually took for granted. From about 1958 to the present, one of his songs was always on the radio. I had no idea what a mammoth legacy of pop music he's left behind. Without a doubt, he is one of this century's finest songwriting talents. This is one of the finest boxed sets I've ever purchased. My personal favorites are Raindrops are fallin on my head, I Say a Little Prayer, I'll Never Fall In Love Again and about 25 others. They're all here. They recall old girlfriends, heartaches, good times, innocent times, especially during the sixties, when we thought we'd be forever young. If you remember these golden times, you need this boxed set. It'll make you fall in love again. Thanks to Austin Powers, I've rediscovered the magic of Bacharach. Classic American pop tunes. A must!

Samsung service botched the repair ticket- they closed it without doing anything. The executive relations department was helpful in getting it sorted out. They even cross-shipped a replacement monitor so I wouldn't have to wait for round-trip shipping.The replacement monitor has now failed. (It's lost sync, so the green image is way out of alignment with the red and blue.) I spent an hour text ""chatting"" with a support person who was friendly in a glacially slow, robotic sort of way.

From what I recall this was definitely one of the better ones. Pick it up if you were a big fan of Aliens and not Alien 3.Ok, just to clear up a little confusion. The reason the characters Billie and Wilks seem so similiar to Newt and Hicks is because they are the same characters. This novel was adapted from a series of Dark Horse comics that came out before Newt and Hicks were killed off in Alien 3. Obviously this posed a problem when they decided to release this novel in '92. So basically they just changed the names and left the story alone. So to all the people who think the characters in this book are unoriginal, think again. This was originally a continuation of Newt and Hicks from Aliens.

264642,"Good For Kids: I bought this MP3 Player for my Middle Schooler, and I was very pleased with the price and quality. It holds enough music, and it's not so expensive that if he loses it that I'll be beside myself with frustration. The two real problems I have are that the headphones broke within two weeks; and we still have no idea how to turn the thing off. (There's an auto shut-off that you can set for 5 minutes of inactivity or something like that, but you can't just manually push an ""off"" button.)Outside of that, it's stylish and small. Uploading the music is very easy...just copy and paste. I'm thinking it has to be in MP3 format. The player doesn't recognize .wma or other file extensions. The setup CD comes with some kind of convert feature, but from what I can tell, it doesn't convert anything into MP3 format.All in all, I would recommend this product for parents who have some knowledge of MP3 devices and don't wish to break the bank buying a one for kids.

The guitars soar, the beat is basic, but listen for the screams. They are ripping loose in the studio, pedal to the metal, closing their eyes and taking their hands off the wheels. Not for nothin' - they died on the same road as Marc Bolan in T. Rex. A dead man's turn for rockstars past and future. To not own Gene Vincent in your collection is to have big, gaping hole.

Of course artists should branch out in new directions. However, that involves taking artistic risks. Radiohead's ""Kid A"" is a great example of artists taking risks and changing their sound dramatically- and even the fans who didn't care for that change still respected the artists. The reason this record is an outrage to most Liz fans is that she isn't taking artistic risks. What's the point of this record? I mean, why not haul Bob Dylan into the studio with the Matrix? We could give him a sexy new makeover, radio-ready tunes, and enhance his vocals to make them pitch-perfect.

55907,"Beware of this company!: I purchased this Italian-English dictionary from this company. The dictionary was actually mediocre in functionality, but more importantly for the purposes of this review, it was faulty. After having bought and tried new batteries on three separate occasions and spending hours trying to get it to work, I wrote to the company. I explained my situation, and asked them for a solution. The experience thereafter was terrible - I was shuffled from one person to the next, to the next, and was finally and ultimately referred to the person I initally contacted! She ignored my communications, and simply referred me to a person I had communicated with before. In the end, the faulty dictionary sits on my desk at home. Beware! This company deserves to go out of business. Do NOT purchase their products, avoid having your money stolen, and avoid a bad experience.

286592,"Good sounding headphones...: I bought these to replace an old pair of Sony wireless headphones that I were never really happy with and finally died on me. I have them hooked up to my bedroom TV and use them at night so I don't keep my girlfriend up. The sound is pretty good, decent bass response, the highs are ok but more importantly the noise level is low. Occasionally I might hear a little static but if I just shift my head one way or the other it goes away. Battery life seems ok. I don't use them every night, maybe once or twice a week for an hour or so and after several months only replaced the batteries once.As I said, I use them in my bedroom only so I cant comment on the range but I don't think they would be good for more than a room away. If your looking for a good sounding decent pair of wireless headphones for watching TV I think these are a pretty good value

The characters are supposed to be suffering during the depression, but everyone has plenty to eat, money for gas, and all strangers that come to town are taken care of -- very unrealistic.

""Traveling Without Moving"" still breathed some influence from his great lines and songwriting, but all releases after that are actually flat and boring compared to the soulful acid jazz extravaganza of the first two albums. Especially the tracks with a house beat really make me cringe. Why does Jay Kay want to appeal to the club going masses so much? The only thing I can think of is: money.Jay Kay of course is fully entitled to go for the big buck before his time in the limelight is up. I just don't want to be witness to his musical decline anymore, so this will likely be the last Jamiroquai-album I will ever have purchased.The only reason why I give this album 2 stars instead of one is the track ""Seven Days in Sunny June"", which still breathes some of the class of Jamiroquai's glory days (although it still would have sounded better with Zender on bass).

There is no specific reason for the selection of the terms discussed but most are concepts that have been the focus of debate among Christians. In fact, Dawn often initiates the discussion by rehearsing opposing perspectives (e.g. liberal, conservative; modern, historical) before attempting to seek some middle ground. But her ""middle"" is usually cause for greater reflection. While recapturing some of the theological weight of key doctrines she attempts to view each concept in light of current developments but with a clear biblical focus. Dawn's leanings are obvious (e.g. feminism, pacifism) but not overt. The book is refreshing.

The thing I'm most disappointed about is that the main outs are RCA and you cannot control the volume.

That is rarely the case with most books that I have read, and I only continued with it in the hopes that the book would start getting better. It never did.I did not find her story telling very compelling, I formed little interest or emotional attachments to the characters, and the crafting of words was nothing special.

She smartly does a medley of her past hits before moving to the central part of the concert. She has visual parts in the show with the dancers acting out the lyrics she sings. Children of the Ghetto is so very well done by her. And songs like My Life, Not Gon' Cry, No More Drama, Family Affair, You Don't Have To Worry, Love At First Sight and many others sound quite good live. Her band and singers sound superb all throughout! Had a lot of the crowd on its feet during most of the songs. Mary does a fine job talking to the crowd about her life, her past experiences, her struggles, her fighting back and other aspects between the songs. It makes the show livelier too.

Much, much, much has changed in the past 3-5 years, particularly related to electric motor flight, foam models (as opposed to balsa and ply), ready-to-fly (everything in one box--airplane, transmitter, onboard electronics, and only 30 minutes assembly time), newer stabilizing and control surfaces (winglets on sailplanes, for example), microelectronics, computer radios (transmitters), quantum leaps in battery technology (lithium polymer), etc.The field has changed.

It's a great story to teach the character traits of Godly people and the illustrations are top notch. I recommend any parent of a 3-7 year old boy to consider this book. The scripture verses are a nice added benefit to back up the traits that are given reenforcing that God commands us to have those traits.

After you've accepted it, Searching For a Former Clarity is still better than everything else out there. This album is good but its about 65% slower than all of their older material and it kinda resinates with cliches. It sounds like Against Me!'s been listening to top 40 alternarock like the strokes and all of that mod crap. Sadly, the acoustic songs on Eternal Cowboy rock harder than all of the songs on this album. It doesn't sound like them. The closest this album comes to recapturing their sound is on the first track Miami. This album sounds like trendy mtv rockers in matching suits. Hopefully they didnt peak on their last album and will revive the sound that their fans liked them for in the future. Please, buy all of their old stuff before this. The lyrics are way too self indulgent.

I've always loved the Betsy-Tacy books, but this book has something the Betsy books doesn't. Maud Hart made everything perfect, but it didn't seem like a corny fairytale.

It all depends on the storyline which this film has none.

168749,"Feelings of a young immature woman: This is a story about mothering. Real mothers, foster mothers, kids mothering each other, mothering yourself. While it is written in beautiful, lyrical language, full of sensuous images, the plot is a bit weak. Astrid, the narrator,sees herself as the product of her many mother figures. Indeed, she is molded by their many influences. Yet, as a young adult, she sees herself as a victim of them all and takes little responsibility for her own development. She masters her own fate more than she realizes. The saga of her various foster homes gets old after awhile, and sometimes the only thing that kept me reading was wondering what happens to Astrid. Ultimately, the book has an emotionally satisfying and realistic ending. The author has captured and poetically expressed typical feelings of a young immature woman. I enjoyed reading this book.

230863,"trades on real-life tragedy: I loved The Alienist and expected to love this book too. I found it slightly disappointing, though -- even before we got to the part that really outraged me. Essentially, the main crime in Angel of Darkness is lifted, all but verbatim, fromSmall Sacrifices: A True Story of Passion and Murder. This is a true-crime book about a tragedy that affected real people who are alive today. We aren't talking about simply drawing inspiration, either; the crime, the victims and especially the courtroom scenes are taken very, very blatantly from the other book. I listened to this on audiobook and therefore do not know if Carr credited that book in his notes. But I found such extreme copying of a tragedy affecting children both uncreative and ghoulish. I have felt no need to read anything else by this author since.

I do think this is an amazing book, and it has worked its way onto my personal classics shelf alongside Fool on the Hill by Matt Ruff, and Good Omens by Neil Gaimon and Terry Pratchett, to name only two. The one thing I would like to say is that Snow Crash has reached outside the cyberpunk circle to include a much larger group of readers. I am a student of mythology, and I have reccomended this book to a number of fellow students and even a professor as an excellent discussion of the modern meanings of myth and language theory. It's a mind-bender, and I think everyone should give it a try!

32734,"Great, if it would stay inflated!: I've had this mattress for less than 6 months, and used it during a move between apartments when we didn't have furniture (roughly 1 weeks use). Unfortunately, on the second use, we discovered that during our sleep, the air slowly deflates from the bed, and if you're sleeping on the side, you'll likely roll off onto the floor - quite a startling experience, let me assure you. Sadly, you can't re-inflate the bed quietly - it uses wall-powered pumps that are very loud - so you're relegated to sleeping in the middle of this bed, and heaven help you if you must share the bed.I tried returning it to Amazon, but the return policy only extends 30 days, so I'm left with a mattress that's ""kinda"" good for a night's sleep, but not worth the money if it pulls these tricks in less than 6 months.

My main reservation, however, centres on the range of sauces developed for various dishes. I all my years eating in Italy (mainly Touscany and Venice), sauces are not something you find in abundance.

49073,"disapointing...: I don't usually write reviews for books that I don't like, because I'm a writer myself, and I know how it feels when people don't like my work, or worse yet, say bad things about it.But this wasn't my type of book. I found that the characters, while well-developed, didn't seem to me to be very realistic. I tend to enjoy some Christian fantasy novels, but this one seemed to be over the top.A lot of the phrases used in the book almost made me cringe. The language seemed hoplessly flowery, and not at all like the type of thing a teenage boy (the main character)would think.I don't want to offend people with this review, but I noticed that most of the other reviews were about how good people found this book. I thought that there should be some mixed opinions in the reviews for a book, especially if some people may have strongly disliked it.

188452,"Wonderful Read-Aloud!: Fantastic book just to read, but an amazing book for teachers to use in the classroom as a read aloud. The author writes this story in a way that almost any comprehension skill can be clearly taught again and again all the way through the book. Character traits are clear, and they show an evolution of each characters emotion and action. There is vivid visualization of places, events, and situations, as well as, cause and effect, prediction/drawing conclusions, author's purpose,etc. All the core reading skills are easy to demonstrate within this text. If you are clever with read-aloud voices you will easily draw students into this tale and leave them hanging at the end of each chapter begging for more. This story really keeps the listener on their toes since it twists and turns and does not often turn out like you think it should. A wonderfully well written book!

279480,"I can't stress enough how superb this book is: It's probably a good idea to take my review with a grain of salt. I like this book so much there's a passage from it tattooed on my thigh. Yes, you did read that correctly.Walter Jon Williams is one of the heavyweights of science fiction. His characters are intellegent and engaging, and his books always have a message, but he doesn't go out of his way to beat you over the head with it.Voice of the Whirlwind, however, is in a class by itself. It has martial arts, love, betrayal, creepy aliens, dry humor, corporate currencies, synthesized drugs, chess, self sacrifice, Uzbekistan...well, basically everything you could ask for in a relaxing, engaging read. Why this book never made the best sellers list is one of the bigger mysteries.I could rant for hours, but the fact is, the crazier I sound, the less likely it is that you'll listen. So *please* give this one a try.

287084,"Whats the BUZZ about t his product: There are two flaws with this product.1) The cradle/charging system is very hard to properly engage although the charging light lets you know when your 5 minutes of struggle has finally succeeded.2) The sound quality (volume and clarity, lack of static) is poor unless you spend al ot of time getting it adjusted just right -- between the controls on my new Sony Bravia LCD TV and those on the headset.I bought this product because I thought the IR transmitter would be compatable with the IR transmitter in my Toyota Sienna entertainment system, and I could use the extra headsets from there as well.I was absolutely right and indeed, they work with the Sony IR transmitter --- and I would say they produce a lot better sound quality than the rechargeable headsets that came with this transmitter.

190546,"Another Title, Not So Pretentious!: First of all, the title is ridiculous. Second, the fundamental problem with this book is that it's pretty much unwritable. If Dunne had written it as a straightforward account of the OJ trial, what could he really have said that hadn't already been written? However, he couldn't really write the book in its current form as non-fiction, either, because too much of it is gossip and rumor--it would've meant multiple trips to the courthouse as he shelled out millions of dollars in libel suits. So I respect the dilemma Dunne was in; I just wish he'd reprinted his essays from Vanity Fair as a collection instead. In its current form, the book is vapid, uninteresting, and basically a reprinting of Dunne's journal. And the end? Talk about a desperate way to link in the other hot topic of the year! Whatever!

I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them and I didn't believe what happened to them when it did happen.

This one involves a woman who loves a sinner; he went to his death before he would divulge their relationship and cause her problems. Little did he know that by his actions, she would forever 'walk these hills' in a long black veil.Before leaving the small town, I would call my local deejays of the morning to request the new release, SHE WALKS THESE HILLS, which gave them something to snicker about as it was an old, old song called THE LONG BLACK VEIL released in the fifties by Ferlin Husky. I later learned that Johnny Cash also had a pretty good version.Ms. McCrumb varies in her subject matter and researches her later books to some extent. This is one of her best. It just may be my favorite of her varied ballads using some of the same colorful characters in Hamblen County, TN -- right up the road a piece from Knoxville.

However, Mr. Goodkind will need to follow-up with a very impressive piece of work if he is to hang on to his legions of fans.

Randy Quaid as one girl's boyfriend was mediocre (see ""The Last Detail"" for his excellent role in a good movie.)Due to music and cultural references, plus the clothes and hair styles, the movie is pretty dated, but that is not a contributing factor to its badness. False dialogue and some typical cliches are factors, however. The partying scenes are also unconvincing, as everyone smokes joints like cigarettes, drinks a lot, and never appears intoxicated.Director Adrian Lyne has made some good movies (""Jacob's Ladder"", ""Lolita"").

Knocking out Tigers routinely. Taking on German tanks with halftrack mounted anti-tank guns and winning routinely. Golly, I have no idea why we lost so many tanks during the war, just send in the TD's - if Superman isn't available.I was hoping for an answer to the more puzzling question of why the US didn't use it's superb 90mm AA guns as anti-tank weapons like the German 88, but regrettably that wasn't addressed.

In Mistresses of Mayhem, Ms. Hornberger makes mistakes so blatant that it calls the whole book into question. One wonders if she did any research at all or just read up on the criminals on the Court Tv Website. She misnames Countess Elizabeth Bathory (the so-called female Dracula) as Bathroy. (No it is not a typo. It is spelled that way all through the book.) In the famous Diane Downs case already well documented by Ann Rule in Small Sacrifices and made into a tv movie seen by many, she misidentifies the daughter who died as Christie who might be surprised by this since Christie not only survived but testified against her mother. (Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial.) Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes. Good research would have made proofreading and this review unnecessary.

There are no check points in any levels so when you die you start all the way back at the beginning and on some levels thats tough because you just barely get by on some parts. Another bad thing is you get killed very easily. Your health drops rediculously fast when someone is shooting you. Also the grenades suck. Everytime I throw a grenade it either lands just a little behind them and doesnt kill them when it explodes or they jump away from it. The first two levels make it seem like an easy game but this game soon becomes a nightmare that I really wish I didnt waste my money on.

Purdy's prose is fluid and disarming, neither condescending nor placating,The downside to these rules of thumb? Purdy does not explain in much depth why violating these rules can hurt your game. But for a beginner, does the reason matter? You'll enjoy the game more if you follow the principles.I suggest reading this book before going on to Seirawan's wonderful and personally genuine Winning Chess series.

As an external drive, it seems to be a solid, well-built(although slightly costly) drive. I was very disappointed at it's ability to transfer VHS to DVD though. After installing the software and reading the manual, I found out that I needed to buy an additional video capture card. The really big problem there is that most cards on the market transfer analog video on your internal drive, making the external writer completely unnecessary. My advice would be to only buy this as a primary writing drive, of which there are equally good and less expensive models out there. If I had to do it over, that would have been my course.

120632,"Works transferring home videos to DVD: It was time for the Luddite to try another DVD recorder. My primary reason for buying was to transfer all the 8mm videos' of the kids to DVD. It did a good job of this and I was able to finish the job I started with a Toshiba recorder. Once I finished that I started converting the big stack of VHS tapes. A binder of 25 DVD's takes up a lot less space then the tapes. This went well. The big glitch is the Macrovision copy protect on some of the movies. I was able to transfer quite a few and get rid of the tapes, anything Disney of course will have Macrovision and wont copy. I have done about 30 DVD's so far and no coasters like the Toshiba would occasionally produce.I did try timed recording on a DVD a few times and that seems to work fine.I read a review that complained that DVD's made with this machine could not be imported to a PC for editing.

Sometimes it shuts off after only 5 minutes if not ""warmed up"" first on a lower setting. I read the product instructions backwards and forwards, and none of this was mentioned. There was a mention of the product shutting off, but it was caviated with the point that this was a very unlikely possibility. Well, I use the product twice a week--once on high for a deep conditioning, and then immediately after for a wet set on a lower setting--and it shuts off twice a week. It just elongates an already lengthy process. Extremely frustrating.

175069,"Dennis Hopper Does Sinatra: An entertaining indie film, also released as THE NIGHT WE CALLED IT A DAY. The story seems romanticized in its view of Frank Sinatra's major dust up with the Aussie press. But it actually happened. Dennis Hopper's performance does sell the story while, at the same time, can be a bit distracting--simply because Hopper bears so little physical resemblance to the legendary crooner. What also makes the film worthwhile is a solid line-up of Australian players now familiar to American audiences, including Rose Byrne who was so dynamic in FX's DAMAGES and Portia DiRossi, better known for her great comic turn in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. Hearing them emote in their native accents, reminds us how easily Aussie thespians can handle our American inflections. Another fine player is Joel Edgerton as the young promoter who bets all his dreams on getting Ol Blue Eyes to perform down under.

Some reviewers said the movie was good because it captured the ethos of low-paid clerks, but I think it was more about two obscene idiots manning a store.

He even goes so far as to call christism ""a powerful and persuasive mistake."" I am sure Pullman knew the reaction he'd get from statements like that, and I admire him all the more for such bravery in the face of the supreme foolishness that has held the world in its sway for so long. If literature contained more honest and thoughtful voices like his, I feel the world would be an infinitely safer and saner place.

Also, some of the Japanese usage is quite strange, and generally a bit outdated.For me, the greatest use is in the vocabulary, however without an index it is quite difficult to track down the specific words.Could be useful to have around, however will need a bit of work, hopefully with a few Japanese scientists, if there is going to be another edition.

I usually pull out the pan halfway through cooking, clear away the built up material, and put it back in.Another pan I had from a different manufacturer with a slightly different design had the same problems, however, so it seems they all suffer from this.The top pan is also a pain to clean because meat gets trapped in the holes.

The parents look to see how dark he is before they even speak to him. They are then relieved that he is actually a couple shades paler than the white...but tanned father. They then proceed to describe him as handsome(i.e. not dark) for the rest of the book. The fiancé was also acceptable because he could speak perfect English because he was educated in England. This whole thing was wrong on so many levels. Since I am a middle aged woman, I have bought and read many novels by this author. This is my last one. This blatant racism and insensitivity hurt my feelings and made me sad.

Especially liked the rotating depth stop gauge instead of the screw down stops found on other cheaper bench top models. Speeds are easy to change and I love the nice sized swivel worktable. Even though it's a benchtop tool, it accepts the accessories the bigger ones do such as the mortise attachment. I built a larger, custom work surface and fence and now leave those on permanently. Forms an awesome work surface. Finally, as expected, the Delta quality and reliability has been perfect. Had it for about five years and definitely would recommend it to anyone without question.

You've got your ""two immortals meet"" theme, your ""immortal tells his/her story to a carefully selected non-immortal"" theme, and your ""immortal escapes from a group trying to kill him/her"" theme.

The recordings are from 1983, except track 5, which is from 1974, and all were preserved on acetate. For some reason, Robbie decided to release this on cd.

Overall, it is only worth it if you are more than a fanatic of Robbie Dupree.Considering the price asked for this, my advise is that you invest your money in other albums from Robbie Dupree : the self-titled one, Walking on water, Smoke and mirrors, or Street corner Heroes.

I had mixed feelings about John Major before reading the book - he had an image of no backbone and being rather boring. However, the book goes into depth of his own background - which was pretty like most of us and not from a rich family - to his entry into the Conservitive Party, to becoming PM after Margaret Thatcher resigned. I found it very easy to read and well written. He had made a big impact on British politics as PM, but most people did not see this and only could see that the Govenment was bitterly fighting over Europe. That was his downful - that he didn't boot out the groaners and troublemakes on Europe. Altogether a good book for insight into this man. Also read Magaret Thatchers book to show how very different they are in leading. Quite a big contrast.

Let me try to explain my less than enthusiastic feeling about this cd. I think that the idea to record a cd with the great Count Basie Orchestra was grand one. As far as the orchestra goes they did their thing. They delivered a whale of a performance. Where the real problem areas came from are at Rosemarys' end.First off, I thought the repertoire was a little weak. Secondly, I thought that Rosemary tried to be too cute by changing the lyrics on some of the songs.. This cd could have been a lot better, if it could have been more conservative. Well, you can't win them all can you? Better luck next time!Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd.

I disagree with others who say that present tense was the problem because it was more than that. I can't quite point my finger on it.

Very nice as a matter of fact. lots of leg room, nice inseam length, and nice fit from the waist to the end of your pockets.

229469,"great.. but better if I'd know less about the period...: It's hard reading a book like this, when my doctoral thesis is on the medical literature of the 1660s. I've read so much about the characters in this novel -- and the true stories upon which it is based -- that it's almost like reading a novel where my friends are the main characters....My gripes about the research: Thomas Willis doesn't get a mention. He supervised the dissection of Anne Greene, led the research into brain anatomy that Lower and Wren assisted with -- Willis's book, ""Cerebri anatome"" was published in 1663 -- and taught anatomy to John Locke. Any study of Oxford in the 1660s ought to mention him.That said, it's a cracking read. And it's good to know that I'm not the only one obsessed with the late seventeenth century's impact. With hope, it will guide more people towards the real stories of the period, which are just as fascinating as this fine modern novel.

120823,"THE MARK OF A GOOD STORY TELLER: Some stories are uplifting, some are funny, some are sad, some are depressing. It is the job of the writer, i.e. story teller to bring a mood to a story. The writer's words should, if done well, bring out emotions. Ms. Haigh has done just that with this novel. The entire book, for me, was quite depressing. That is good. It shows that the author did her job and struck a note that I am sure she was shooting for. If the other reviews here are any indication, I am not alone with this emotion as others found the same feelings in reading this work. The subject matter alone is enough to get one down. I cannot say I enjoyed this work, but then again, not all stories are written to make one happy. I cannot recommend this one for those who are looking for a ""happy book"" but can recommend it as a story well written in which the author accomplished just what she set out to do.

She proves herself, not only to be a most worthy Tosca but also an absolutely valid interpreter of Italian repertoire besides her unsurpassable Turandot (Ballo, Aida, Macbeth).Franco Corelli is a dashing Cavaradossi, at turns tender and heroic, capable of controlling his towering instrument to match the dramatic action. His third act is truly ravishing. A reference portrayal.Once you get past Fischer-Dieskau's mannerisms and Maazel's, at times, rather lacklustre conducting, you're faced with a very good recording of Puccini's opus.Don't be fooled: this is far from being one of the worst recordings ever made!

Now I wanted to see them in Color. So far I have watched 4 movies, only one was a choice of black & white or Color. I am very disappointed in this.

213891,"Better than you might expect: This is not a typical ""B"" Western. Jimmy Stewart plays a man with a dark side, and a dark past for a change. He had about given up Westerns because he found himself playing parts that were too similar too often. This one was different.Playing opposite Julie London, who played a saloon singer whose complaint was that everyone made passes at her, she fell into a situation (along with Stewart) where she was subjected to real brutality--tastefully handled. Lee J. Cobb played the heavy, and did his usual great job. Stewart was thrown back in with his old gang, from whom he had escaped once, and again was expected to rob banks and kill.The story was good, and the acting was superb, as might be expected from such a cast. A dark, forboding film, which will hold your attention.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books

A total waste of time, except for Cillian Murphy's performance, but even that couldn't save this cinematic disaster.There is no chemistry between actors/characters, and the idea that the film delves into ""philosophical dilemmas"" is laughable.Save your money.

254676,"Up to King's standard, which is superb: King really does not know how to write a bad novel. Such is the depth of her imaginative penetration of her characters' minds and hearts that the reader finishes her books knowing the characters better than most of their real acquaintances. King specializes in strong women confronted by serious challenges, some of which exist in the worlds they live in, and some of which are internal. This science fiction novel imagines a post-catastrophic world in which women are the adventurers as a matter of necessity, men having been sharply reduced as a percentage of the population. Among the pleasures of the novel are the heroine, Dian, an action hero who must accomplish a great feat of liberation while (unexpectedly) pregnant, and two male characters who inspire Dian to heroics without being action heroes themselves. To say nothing of the dog. If you're interested in character tested by ordeals and the best qualities of dogs and humans, you will be thrilled by this book.

The first half contains some of Soft Cell's best songs, and the second half of the album is Marc Almond's solo work. Many of the songs are remixes, but a casual fan won't care as they are very similar to the originals. Marc has a beautiful voice, definitely one of my favorites; unfortunately his lyrics are sometimes weak and he occasionally comes off as a bit too exuberant. Regardless, this is one of my favorite discs. Standout tracks include ""Torch,"" ""Tears Run Rings,"" and ""Something's Gotten Hold of my Heart"" (a duet with Gene Pitney).

70249,"New Mahler 4 Delivers: I am a true fan of Boulez's new Mahler recordings, especially his incomparable first symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This is no exception. The last movement lacks some of the clarity of the rest, and the soprano sings clearly, but without the ""innocence"" asked for by Mahler. (Bernstein's recording goes as far as to use a boy soprano). The first movement orchestral work is superb, including all of the treacherous horn solos, tempo changes and textures. The second movement, with it's ""devil's fiddle"" solo (first violin tuned up a whole step) is exquisitely eerie. On the opposite side, the third movement is serene as possible and a perfect set-up to the poem of the fourth: Das Himmlisches Leben (the Heavenly Life), which is the last of Mahler's settings from Das Knaben Wunderhorn. All in all, this recording is not quite what Boulez's Mahler 1 is, but it still displays a beautiful, new version of a great symphony.

Instead they created a clunky resource hog that makes something that should be fun incredibly aggravating. I was running the game on an older PC that was capable of running Bethesda Softworks' Oblivion. The result, Gothic 3 ran like a Yugo on one good cylinder (a sign of poor coding). Moreover, its characters are dull and uninspired (even its introduction scenes are bland). Aspyr should have never released this monstrosity.Bottom line: Gothic 3 is a waste of my money. I am sorry I purchased it. Aspyr has proven to be a poser. If you are interested in open-ended fantasy adventure, go with Bethesda Softworks' Elder Scrolls III, Morrowind or Oblivion.

101082,"The best of the 2-episode videos: Jackie Mason was a perfect choice to play Krusty's father, a rabbi who disowned his son for going into entertainment. he gives a wonderfully charismatic showing (""Who's in charge here? There's no-one in charge here?"") as Bart and Lisa attempt to convince him to accept his son's career. Another great moment was Bart's misunderstanding of the phrase ""I have no son!"" (which Homer later repeated in 'The Principal and the Pauper')Bart the Murderer was another clever concoction. The explanation given as to Skinner's disappearance was so unlikely it was comical, and the representation of the seedy world of Gangland businesmen was satirical and clever. A strongly recommended tape.

You may never need one.My recommendation is to get the Wii, play for a month and check to see how much space you have. then if it's necessary buy a scandisk.

It is okay, but Catena is not really doing anything that Glenn Hughes has not already done, and better. It is not hard to listen to and it is a bit of a grower.

I recommend threading the rope through each stage (there are 4 sections) before mounting to the ceiling.One thing that you should know is that it is not really possible to get your bike all the way to the ceiling. I tried placing the clips in different places (i.e. wheels, bar, etc.), but then the balance of the system was lost and it became difficult to raise uniformly. So, be aware if your overhead is tight. You should add about 6-10 inches onto the height of your bike to determine how low it will hang.There were a lot of higher priced alternatives, but this one worked fine.

Unlike most of the rice (with pasta usually cut in) dishes on the market, you can really smell it cooking from a room away, and when you first open the foil package the mix is kept in to stay fresh, you get a blast of the spices as well.

Since this edition predicts that the world as we know it will end in May 2001, it will be interesting to see if a new edition comes out which moves the day of doom ahead so that this cult guru can continue to collect on other people's hard-earned income.Even just as an intellectual exercise, this book holds no value. The storyline is choppy and holds no continuity. The author goes in and out of predicting the future and self-glorification. Save your money.

With all the quality options for children's books out there, don't bother with this series. While the United States educational system struggles to teach children to read and write correctly, our schools offer them things like this. If you want to teach bad grammar and manners, go right ahead. It's such a shame. These funny stories could have been told just as well, without any schlock included. Thanks, but no thanks.

Ironically, while many argue that Plato was calling for just such a utopia, a strong argument can be made that Plato was in fact pointing out the weakenesses with just such a creation. Plato's allegory of the cave is, perhaps, the most eye opening part of the text.

121419,"Wonderful: I really loved this short book and it was exactly what I have come to expect from Alice Hoffman. I read some of the other reviews that stated that the characters were not well developed and that it was a book of short stories. Wrong on both counts. Part of what I love about AH is the sense of mystery and wonder she creates in her characters. The sense that you never really know someone...or something. There is much that you will never know. The book flowed perfectly from chapter to chapter and I couldn't put it down. Thanks Alice Hoffman for making me stay up past my bedtime once again!

273351,"Ice Cube's Excellent and ""Unknown"" Side project: I decided to purchase Da lench Mob's ""Planet of the Apes"" back in 1992, not because I knew who they were, but when I browsing through the Hip-Hop section, I saw that Ice Cube had produced this CD, and I thought I give it a shot. Not only was that appealing, there were 3 guys on the back of the album cover with full fledge ski mask's on, I and thought, man this album is going to be hard as hell. The album didn't dissapoint. Not only was the album hard as hell (the opening track starts off with a hard beat and some guy talking about execution styles used) but the group showed some real talent on the mic. This would be a short lived project, as Da Lench Mob only stuck around for another album, yet this is one that Hip-Hop fans shouldnt let pass by. Even though its been 14yrs since its release, its still classic ""Hardcore"" Hip-Hop, and I cant reccomend it enough to people that are fans of the genre. ENJOY

It was all so fascinating. It wasn't until she started discussing how we can also develop our second sight that she lost me.

They're in the business of mass production. That's why this small-town, small-batch-made candy is the best you'll ever taste out of a package. It makes the other candy companies pale in comparison. Being from Ohio, I also grew up on Mallo cups but found it hard to find in DC/Northern Virginia, though it's at some Mom and Pop convenient marts in the country. Still, now that I can purchase online, I plan to dole it out to friends and family to get them hooked and then tell them how to order themselves so that this company never goes out of business.

The doll is thick wood and the pieces are very thick plastic, it all comes in a nice wooden box. The lid slids off easily though, so I don't recommend that part for travel. We put it in a ziplock for travel. It is easy for a toddler to place the pieces on the doll and mix and match fun. I think it's helpful to have two dolls so Mom or friends can play together.

Is it possible these performances are truer to Prokofiev's intent than others and I have just been conditioned incorrectly? Maybe, but man these are in a hurry. Immediately after enduring Symphony No. 3, I listened to Jarvi's version with Scottish National just to cleanse and reorient.

I did notice, however, that there were several typos throughout the book, an incorrect equation and paths to the wrong figures, but they weren't big enough to distract me.

1970,"depressing and scary: I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome, along the lines of, ""when not even one of the triplets lived, I went out and got drunk,"" and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact, my twins were born naturally, five days before the predicted due date, had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about, and were in excellent health. In fact, I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition, the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So, unless you like being scared, I recommend against buying this book.

Apparently, he's showing his ""true inner self"" and is no longer the ""Be all/ Know all"" whom we've all come to expect. The other characters continue to grow and develope as well, and there is enough residual suspense to heighten our anticipation of next season's offerings. Overall, this season wasn't quite as good as Season 3 --down from 5-Stars to 4-Stars. But it was still a heckuva lot better than a lot of the other stuff found on TV.

125528,"Great Humidifier...: I purchased this because it is very dry in the winter in Colorado. It is a lot bigger than I thought - that's not a bad thing. It is extremely easy to use... just fill up and push the on button. The instructions are very simple. One thing I like about it is that it is ultrasonic (it uses a metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency to create water droplets. It is not loud, and also produces a cool fog.). No extensive cleaning needed, no adding bleach to the water, etc. It does the job great. There is one little thing that bothers me... the on light is green (it turns red if it runs out of water) and it is very bright at night. I like my room to be dark and this tiny light really lights up a room. I did cover it up with some electrical tape and now it doesn't bother me. Other than the light (which was an easy fix), I love this humidifier.

If I could give this a negative rating I would. Apologies to Cub Koda and his much more generous review. This performance was by any measure sub par, the horrible recording quality, mislabeled tracks, and general lack of accurate information makes this one of those items you wish you had never found.

On Old Ways, he sounds like he's faking it. He sings these cover songs like he's at a kareoke. Worst of all, he sings with a twang that is equal parts irritating and laughable. Maybe that was his point--showing the world he didn't care. This album does kind of come across as an inside joke. Buy this album only if you're a Young completist. Otherwise, stay away. Trust me.

Each episode contains a kid-sized life-lesson with Biblical truths throughout. The animation is superb, voice talent amazing, and the story-line engaging.In this episode, you meet Stanley, whose greatest fear is that others will not like him. The other bugs want to like Stanley, but because of his stink, it is difficult for them to overlook the smell and really get to know him. The storyline also touches on doubt and being able to ask God the ""why"" questions of life. Every Hermie and Friends story opens up a dialogue for children and their parents. In the end, the bugs discover why Stanley stinks and that God made him that way for a very important reason.

Her voice has deep emotion and passion. The songs are mostly ballads with her usual ""pop-rock"" style. ""Making Love (Out of Nothing At All)"" reminds me of ""Total Eclipse of the Heart."" And some rock songs such as ""Driving Me Wild"" is reminiscent to ""Hide Your Heart."" Overall, I would highly recommend this to rock fans, or a Bonnie Tyler fan.

While Departure has its moments of their previous rollicking nature, it is by far more focused on the rock side of their overall sound. The first clue to this is the lack of any traditional covers, rather, a cover of the Nirvana hit ""Come As You Are"" (done incredibly, by the way). The tone of this album is a bit more solemn than previous albums, but they have not lost their freewheeling spirit or folky edginess. They've just matured... a whole lot.

The author, in a short space, effectively gives a history of the American Revolution from its ecomonic, demographic and ideological origins through the war itself and into the second revolution, that of the creation of the constitution. The story is told clearly and made interesting, sticking conservatively to the basic outline without adding any of the more radical views of recent years. This volume is definately not for those overly familiar with the Revolution but would be a good beginning or a refresher for those interested in the outlines of this fascinating event.

So, for example, there is an impressive analysis of the ""Federalist Papers"" [especially Madison's contributions] interlaced with an evaluation of the misreadings over time that have now been embraced so willingly by our contemporaries. The writing is clear, the endnotes useful, and the total product an impressive one, in terms both of helping us understand our fascinating past and giving some order to the confusion of our current political climate.

McCartney really did well playing the instruments and credit must go to the producer. If there's anywhere the album fails, it's the lyrics which at times recall Paul's worst. But for the better part of the album they are at least tolerable and sometimes quite good. They do hold the album back from being a true classic, though. They don't really hurt the album very much, just hold it back a bit. I have been listening to it all week and like it more and more. The best songs are Friends to Go, English Tea, Too Much Rain and Promise to you Girl. The others are also good, but not quite. Overall, a return to better days for Paul and highly recommended.

Sitting on the waffle grille side is not very smooth -- I can find no evidence of any ""gel"" utilized in this product at all -- it is merely an open gridwork of pretty soft rubber with a flimsy cover. It is easy enough to compress the grillework between your fingers, so sitting on it flattens it out pretty quickly. Look at the picture with the cover peeled back -- that's all there is to it. It's really not a premium product and is certainly not worth the $60 Amazon advertises it for by another supplier. With shipping, this item came to over $40, and it's just not worth it in my opinion.

For me the highlight is ""The City Sleeps"" by MC 900ft Jesus, a slowly burning groove beneath a tale of metropolitan arson. But hip-hop is just one facet of Rare on Air Volume 2 - from Joni Mitchell's 90's folk to Cibo Matto's trippy pop, the whole series shows the true value of public broadcasting. Commercial broadcasters just don't (or won't), showcase such a wide variety of musical styles. Without commerce as their raison d'etre, stations such as KCRW can afford to broaden the horizons of their listenership, and that's why a CD like Rare on Air should be part of any open-minded music fans collection.I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do!

You have to pour over the sink or else it spills everywhere, no matter how slowly or carefully you pour. Also, if you forget to dump out left over coffee (which is easy to forget since you can't see the contents) in just a couple days, literally, it molds. I don't even understand how it can get so moldy so quickly. Even if I do dump out the coffee, unless I actually wash the carafe very thoroughly, there will be little bits of mold all over the interior after a few days. And most importantly, the coffee tastes horrible. Horrible. I'm not even a picky coffee drinker.I really want to like this coffee pot because it's so nice looking, but I'm just so completely dissatisfied.

Now I can put fresh batteries in and if I hold it just right I can take a few pictures, then the low battery icon comes on the screen and it goes dead, even without retracting the lens.

Yes, but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 F andd 131 F. This clock is NOT water-resistant.""Living in New England, we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 F. The clock has a VERY misleading description!

225212,"Breathtaking: one of the most amazing films to ever be made. Rosetta is the compelling and moving story of a young girl that faces hardships beyond her years. Loss of a job, dealing with her alcholic mother and the center of all of this desperation, to have a good life, and get things going in the right direction, she betrays a friend, begs for jobs and sneaks in and out of the trailer park she and her mother live in, ironically called ""the grand canyon"".Rosetta has an iron clad determination that drives her, and she will not give up no matter what.An extremely real, gritty, emotional and touching film that won numerous awards for the actress playing rosetta(?milie Dequenne) as well as for Jean-Pierre Dardenne & Luc Dardenne at the cannes film festival.An absolute treasure.

Works less well for small base items (like the drill press I have on it) - raising one side onto the casters tends to make it a little unstable on a small footprint.Works well on a good smooth surface, not so well on an uneven floor.And yes, I'm getting ready to buy another one, to go under my radial arm saw.

179209,"Rissa Victorious: ""The Long View"" concludes the saga of Rissa Kerguelen. The first two books in the trilogy set the stage for this one: the conquest of Earth. In those earlier books, we saw little-girl Rissa, torn from her family and raised no better than a slave in a corporate concentration camp. We saw her escape, befriend the powerful Hulzein dynasty, leave for the stars, and become co-leader of the rebel forces.Now, she returns. It's been years of preparation - decades and lifetimes, if you take the ""long view"" of relativistic time dilation and suspended animation. But factors arose that Rissa's group could never have foreseen: a doomsday bomb, and a madwoman with its detonator always at hand.For all that, this book and this series convey a family-based feel-goodism that are easy to enjoy. They remind me of Heinlein's happy communes, in ways, but with more swashbuckling and more of the hero[ine] with humble beginnings.-- wiredweird

You get the sense that air circulates inside this pillow. As another review said, it's perfect great to plump up and punch into a shape you like, but I also agree with the other reviewer who said that your head drops into a hole by the morning. I was told my a local vendor that there are (or were) different variations of this pillow...with a ""super-stuffed"" version that keeps this from happening. I made 2 pillows out of 3 of these to solve the problem...I now take some with me when I go on road trips. The language about the material used in the filling is pretty elaborate for what appears to be shredded plastic dry-cleaning bags. But I love this pillow. I no longer wake with a stiff neck, and that is worth a lot of $$. Gave two to my elderly mother and she absolutely loves them.

I is highly original, which is one thing that should be valued, especially in cartoon/animation pictures.The plot is strong, but I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with a sequel. There's room for this to grow even more.I do have to say that this was much better on the big screen though, simply because of the nature of the film. It's a kid's action animation.

Moreover, the chance that this message appears so close to the start of the book is less than 1 in 200,000, so, according to Drosnin's logic, it must be there by design and not by accident.

To my non-Hispanic ears, there two Anglo guys sounded very authentic in their renditions. I liked the spontaneous improvisations in La Bamba: probably the most lively rendition I have heard of the original, non-Ritchie Valens version.But as sometimes happens, hearing too many similar songs at one setting can get boring. For me, anyway, I can take only so much uninterrupted folk music at a time. Spread out, the numbers are more pleasing to the ear.

You can't log off to a different username without having to shutdown the program first then relog nor can you delete usernames. No BGMs (backgroundmusic)during chess matches.Other than that, its an awesome tactical training tool.

Not a lot really happens and there is nothing earth-shattering, but it does a very nice job of examining marriage, love and life just before middleage. Written by James L. Brooks I am suprised no one in Hollywood has thought to create a remake. A great value at the price and if you have broadband internet access it can also be viewed for free from...

I would charge them in sets of four, let them site for one week, then put them on a tester to see which ones were bad. I found that they normally show about 1.29V-1.30V after sitting a week, but the bad ones show about .95V. I am not at all happy with the 2500 MAh batteries, however, I was happy with Energizer's previous 2200 and 2300 MAh versions.

(one could put lesser-used appliances up, for example. like our waffle iron that seems too important to be tucked into a cabinet but not so important as to need to be on the counter.)but, it might be unfair to count these as flaws of the product itself. i'm still happy with it!

Another thing I like is I can go back and grab a chapter for review and not have to worry about having read the other chapters. One final thought is that I appreciate how both sides of an argument are addressed. The author doesn't simply state the position he believes and leave you wondering about the other side of the story. He discusses the challenges that the theological position he is taking often faces.

I was skeptical about the dvd part because I had heard about the minimal recording time, etc but I didn't understand the different disk formats I guess. Anyway, I am very pleased with this camcorder, and being able to shoot in a 16:9 format is also a nice feature I didn't even think about at first.

I picked up this CD mostly out of curiosity, for I had heard many others rave about her. To be honest, I wasn't that impressed. Dalbello clearly models herself on Kate Bush, right down to the alternately scream/whisper vocals. None of the songs flow very well, the lyrics are for the most part oh-angst-is-me streams of consciousness, and the arrangments range from baffling to ludicrous. But when she clicks, as on ""Gonna Get Close To You"" and ""Wait For An Answer"", which was later covered by Heart, you can hear her potential, at least as a songwriter.

Why Seth Rogan, or anyone else, would want to have any association with this is beyond me. Moronic, mean-spirited, unfunny, hateful, violent, obscene just to be obscene, you name it, this chunk of garbage has it. I rented it and only watched it after the first few minutes just to see if it could really be as horrible has it promised. And it was. This picture is a disgrace to the industry if not to the the human race in general.

In this ensemble effort, he is in just a few scenes, playing the Prime Minister of England who is inexplicably attracted to a foul-mouthed female assistant. If that's not enough, there's a couple starring in a porn film who are too shy to even kiss on their first date. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this movie can't decide if it's concentrating on its R rating or trying to be a feel-good movie. It tries to do both and doesn't succeed very well in either effort.

48962,"Continues where the other Artemis Fowl books leave off!: This series is a good introduction to sci fi thrillers for the younger reader. And anything that gets them to read and not drain their brain in front of the TV or video game is a plus.This book reads easy but not too simple so it will keep their interest. Probably better suited for a boy than girl, as it continues with a steady diet of flatulence humor, as did its predecessor.This story surrounds Opal Koboi. It involves clones, high tech gadgets, and takes the young reader on a journey of Fowl after his mind has been erased of memories of faries and the such.If your child liked the first books, he will enjoy this one as well.

193860,"A bad joke...: In all honesty, before Info Society...or shall I say, Kurt Harland, released this album, I was a big-time Info Society fan. Now, I'm not, any longer. The lyrics on this album are very depressing, melodramatic, negative and indicative of a loss of confidence and happiness. The music is very unintellectually organized, discordant, and depressing. Notwithstanding, I'm not a stickler for gothic, dark type of music, I'm not a hater of it, either. But THIS album, -while having SOME talented and cool elements, musical-wise in CERTAIN parts of songs, is just a joke. It was a total waste of money. It was obviously produced/invented by a spiritually-marred frame of mind. The only way I can see one enjoying this album, or finding it pleasing or gratifiying in any way is if he/she is marred him/herself and used to depressing, dark music and lyrics.

I explored Judaism almost three years ago when I started dating a Jewish man and this was a great beginning step for me. It provides facts, albeit brief, into history, teachings, and beliefs. So many of my questions were answered in the first few chapters. If you don't have a lot of time to read, this is also a great book because it's so thorough and user-friendly. It's a great resource to ground you into more complex teachings later.I recommend this fun book to anyone wanting to learn more about this amazing religion, or as a brush up!

This was right when the Grateful Dead started to play psychadelic music which would later be showcased in their acid rock masterpiece Anthem of the Sun a year later. I think this is a pretty underrated album and it is a good showcase, especially with a live version of their first open-ended jam song which would sow the seeds for Dark Star, Viola Lee Blues.Since this is very different from their later albums, it is very special and I would say it isn't a very good intro but if you are getting into the Dead, I say welcome friend.

Ron Donaghe continues to bring to bear his considerable skill as a writer and storyteller himself, working in real-life events from the era of his story (in this case, the early 1970's) to make the tale that much more vivid. Donaghe writes with a compassion and respect that leaves the reader feeling like he just spent time with old friends by the time the story concludes. A must read for all fans of Will's story, old and new. --Andrew Barriger, author of Finding Faith.

4447,"A must for hard house fans: Well I got this CD for Christmas and I am extremely pleased with it. I think CD 1 which is more hard house than trance is the better - mainly for Florian F's Surreal Brazil which is a masterpiece - But still I like the harder feel of this disc. Number 2 is definitely lighter and trancier but gets a bit harder towards the end although it is spoiled at the start by using too many tracks with vocals(I think a definite no-no in trance), but even so there are some gems like Moogwai's Viola. So overall if you like stompier hard house tunes, buy it and listen to CD 1. CD 2 has too many cheesy vocals for me, so if you want good trance, wait for the soon-to-be-released Binary Finary album instead.

Once I realized it wasn't, I hoped the characters in the book would be as well developed as the characters in the Scarpetta series. I was sorely disappointed. I guess, though, when you've written as many excellent books as Cornwell has, you're entitled to a flop.

After that volumes 4-8 are all 13 episodes per volume at $30+ each. Greed is what I call it and in this economy, its outrageous. I don't know about you but I'll wait until it drops to $19.99 or less before I'll buy it. Same goes for American Dad.Oh and about the writer's strike, just an excuse to only release the 13 episodes per volume. Fox could have waited for the strike to be over and release full seasons per volume and the year the strike happened, release that season and price it appropriately for the short fall of episodes.

By Your Side is a great cd which conveys the southern rock and roll styles that has been sorely missed for the past few years. This is true rock and roll at it's finest. If you enjoy Aerosmith or the Rolling Stones, I recommend this cd. The first single ""Kickin My Heart Around"" sums up what the Crowes are about. They might not have the most talent in the world, but they are great at what they do, rock hard! A must hear!

Several songs here could be seen as a discussion of the imminent failure of his first marriage, but this is not just a divorce album, as several songs deal with the happier side of romance, and the hard rocker ""Spare Parts"", which sounds like the Outlaws in some ways, is also here. Although members of the E Street Band play on this CD, they're rarely in full-band arrangements. However, this is made up for by some of Springsteen's most thoughtful songs ever.

75915,"Very good, mostly serious, jazz: David Murray and lyricist Ishmael Reid made this CD inspired by 'Banished', which is about African-Americans who were kicked out of their homes. So, it's serious stuff. Cassandra Wilson sings on the first and last songs, and Murray's quartet with Lafayette Gilchrist, Ray Drummond, and Andrew Cyrille play throughout. Much of the music, as you might expect, is blues-based and timeless. It doesn't say modern nor throwback, which is what you'd expect from someone whose free jazz albums continue the jazz tradition. ""Transitions"" and ""Family Reunion"" are upbeat and positive-sounding. The playing is strong throughout - David Murray is one of the contemporary greats. Cassandra Wilson's vocals are also very good. The lyrics on the opener are more serious, and the lyrics on the closer are a little more playful. The liner notes say Reid played with the meaning of ""Cassandra"".This is recommended for Murray fans, or any fans of jazz, really.

I got on the their website to find out how to get it repaired and sent it in for repair. I didnt hear anything for weeks. I called a number of times to get status and they couldnt find it. I was finally told that they dont repair 9150s so there was no need to find it. If these cost $50 or so I would consider it a throw-away but not for this price.

I had originally bought it without ever hearing the song ""Breathe (2 AM) thinking I would have a CD by someone that no one else would have heard of. I soon realized that this was a dumb move and returned the CD to the store the next day. So later on, a few weeks or so later, I had been hearing ""Breathe (2 AM)"" all over the radio. So I decided to venture out yet again and buy this CD. Now I am so glad that I bought it. Every song on the CD is as great as the one before it. My personal favorites and ""Citadel"", ""Satellite"", and ""Consider This"". I am sure and I am also hoping that you as a buyer will enjoy this CD as much I do.

This is street-flavored, no-holds-barred ""Salsa Dura"" at its rawest best from one of Puerto Rico's last great soneros. It's worth noting that Marvin was already suffering from diabetes-related complications by the time this CD was issued (he would eventually have one of his legs amputated) and he would die on October 6, 2004. This album forms an important part of his musical legacy. May he rest in peace.

However, I hate the straps! They get twisted, and uneven, and require a lot of messing with that I'd prefer to avoid. Thankfully this is our secondary seat, not the one we use the most, or I think I would be tearing my hair out.We've used ours for about 2 years and the fabric is okay so far, but again it's not the main carseat for us.

It even had some action scenes. Many movies which combine genres (i.e. action and comedy) wind up successes. It's not a bad formula.Although Whoopi Goldberg is the undeniable star of this movie, Kathy Najimy as ""Sister Mary Patrick"" almost steals the show as the bubbly nun. However, always a sucker for a pretty and wholesome face, I preferred Mary Wickes as ""Sister Mary Lazarus."" She had this shy countenance to her before blossoming with her voice. Maybe that's why she had the name Lazarus as her personality rose from the dead.

The essence of Christianity is a relationship with God not requirements ( works or belief in correct doctrine). Borg follows in the tradition of Paul Tillich and of John A. T. Robinson, author of ""Honest to God"" (1963), the best book that I have ever read on Christianity.

While the limited budget is evident, I have to say the movie (or novella if you prefer for a feature only about 50 minutes long) was much better than I expected.The silent movie feel suits the material very well. The acting is serviceable but in keeping with the overall tone of the film. In the end this is a very suitable telling of Lovecraft's classic story.All that being said, to make the purchase of the film worthwhile you really have to be Lovecraft devotee. I could see where someone new to Lovecraft might not ""get"" the film. Previous reviewers are correct in their criticism of the special effects. While the Cthulhu monster fits into the overall feel of the film, it lacks the terrifying zing modern audiences have come to expect in their onscreen terrors.

Combined with a great pair of supportive gym shoes, my SmartWools carried me through day hikes on the savannas of the Masa Mara, across airport fields, long game drives, and back home again. SmartWool Socks are the best choice for friction-free walking and absorbent materials that wick away moisture.

There are certain passages that describe the main character's day-to-day life that seem so realistic that you feel uncomfortable just reading it. The naivety of Link (the main character) as he sets out to survive in a hard new world provides Swindells with an excellent tool to show just how tough an existence this can be. Swindells also deals with broader issues concerning community attitudes to the homeless. The way people react to being approached by homeless people.This is made exciting through the use of a thrilling story about an ex-soldier who is stalking and murdering homeless people. A sort of one-man mission to rid the streets of this ""filth"". When Link becomes his tartget the reader is swept along to a thrilling conclusion. This combination of suspense and social comment make for an entertaining and thought-provoking read.

The material was rich and could have been used more effectively if Burke had not tried so hard to make his ancestor, Willie Burke, a man of mixed mind about slavery and the causes of the war.

145216,"A Bencolin Mystery: In the eerie green light of a sepulchral old museum of waxworks the French detective Bencolin stumbles across the body of a young girl with a knife in her back placed in the arms of a sinister figure of the Satyr of the Seine. That same morning the body of another young girl had been found stabbed in the back, floating on the Seine river.Trails lead directly to the infamous Club of the Silver Key: it is known that the propietor's mistress entered the waxworks museum at the time of the murder and was never seen to leave. What connection is there between the musty waxworks and the exotic modern club? What happened to the silver keys belonging to the murdered girls?The Corpse in the Waxworks is by far the best Bencolin mystery that J.D. Carr has written.

This was bad. Awful script with zero character development, it made absolutely no sense (which would be fine if they stuck with the original nonsensical premise, but they TRIED to have it make sense!), and Johnny Depp (who I usually love) was just way too far out this time around. Short of a great performance by Helena Bonham-Carter, this was nothing but an impressive visual 120 minutes. That's not enough for me. Some people can sit and just watch CGI for hours and think it's brilliant. Personally, I'd like a well-told story and fully-formed characters. This had neither. And considering how fertile the material is, I consider that inexcusable. Again, a major disappointment.

And it also contains within it the great love story of Chagall's life with his first wife Bella. Chagall writes with intensity and strength much the way he paints. The difficulty of his early years is somehow transcended by his devotion to his artistic vocation. This is a recommended work for all those who care about the relation of the artist to his life, and of the creator of great beauty to his artistic task.

This is so ... every other band. every song on this album sounds like another band could have written it. Even the lyrics sound like they were written by someone else. I don't know, these guys have lost their edge. I was somewhat disappointed after John Nolan left the band and Where You Want To Be was released, because it was kind of lame how Adam Lazarra was imitating john nolan or something, but it was still that Taking Back Sunday sound. Now it's just generic pop-punk-emo, the only thing thye have going for them is sweet harmonies and the familiar voice. This is the transition album. I'm not really into it at all, but for those who have never liked taking back sunday before, this new album is really catchy.

The manufacturer claims that it is also oven and freezer safe; but I can't comment on that because I haven't used it in the oven and freezer.Although this is made to be a salad plate; this can also be used for deserts and meals with smaller portions. Great!The design of the plate is very smart. The dark shade of blue in the center is nicely complemented by the warm, earthy tones with abstract shapes all around the circumference of this nine inch wide plate. The overall effect certainly does give it that vibrant southwest feel; the design can also go with many contemporary and even modern dining room sets.This salad plate is hand painted; that impresses me. There is a five year warranty but with the great design of these plates I doubt you'll ever need it! When I handle the plate it feels very sturdy and solid.Get a set of these plates today--and enjoy!

I wanted to get a back up even though the original one is still pulling out corks as well as ever.The current model differs in that the handle attaches at one end inside of in the middle. One might think that this would provide better torque, but added torque isn't needed because of the success of the overall design. Instead the offset handle creates more instability while turning it. On the other hand, the new version encloses the sharp point of the corkscrew better, which might be a benefit if one anticipates carrying it in a pocket.

The quantity offered in this pack is really convenient, because it's possible to keep rolls in multiple rooms and always have one on hand--which is very welcome, since a house becomes a mess in the moving process! Because I like to really reinforce packing tape (putting it on all open edges of a box, and sometimes along the glued portion rather than just down the center ""seams""), the one improvement these rolls could have would be to have more tape on them. Another variety of packing tape I've used from Scotch has more yardage on it.Tip: I don't like dispensing packing tape the traditional way. Before starting a roll, I remove it and flip it over, then put it back in the dispenser. I pull out the length I need, cut it on the dispenser's teeth, and center the tape by using both hands. Switching the roll around also helps keep the tape from reattaching to itself better this way, because the tape sticks to the teeth.

The translation is very good, marked only by inconsistant spellings of proper names which should have been picked up by any editor. The style is simple enough that any student with a good base of Latin grammar should be able to translate with the help of a dictionary, as the vocabulary will be in any basic lexicon.

Of course, their indie roots have been plucked, and they probably don't have much cred left (unless playing the viper room is credible). Fame and fortune are what these harvard educated rich kids are after. If you don't mind music without any integrity and you aren't impartial to the sweetest, stickiest bubblegum pop, then you might not mind the PUSH KINGS. But in desperately cultivating a retro image (complete with floppy hairdo's and tight clothing), they are miscalculating their appeal while their music alienates their indie fan base (if it hasn't already). If they are big in Japan, so am I.

On another note, the soundtrack really kicks ...and very much in line with the scenes I had pictured when reading the book.Nothing about the twins, nothing about Pandora and nothing about quite a few other characters.

Then set up the Vetter filing system and you will always have a place to put your information so it won't be on your desk. It is not just about a better information handling system (which it is) it is about a MUCH better way to work.With so many business books out there this is the one that will absolutely increase office productivity, one desk at a time. So many of us were let loose in an office with no direction. Greg has the system to make an office hum with far less stress.

The MP5 has performed quite well in the field. I actually took this gun to my first ever team pracitce and found that I was able to hold my own against several MUCH more expensive guns. This gun (at least the one I got) comes with 2 magazines one standard and one winding. The semi and full auto modes both work very well, and the rate of fire and power are quite impressive for an entry level electric gun. Mine came with a mock scope that had illuminated crossairs that actually work suprizingly well. This is a VERY good gun for backyard wars and a very good entry level gun for those looking to get into airsoft but dont want to spend $200+ for a high end AEG.

My last set was a pair of Sony MDR's; the sound quality on both is comparable, however this pair is much more sturdy- the Sony's had frayed at the part where the earbud wires separate. I have two minor objections- the cord is just a bit short for my 5'10' height when I wish to put my mp3 player in my pockets; I usually end up using my breast pocket of my jacket. Also, while sturdy, the wires have a tendency to get a bit tangled. Overall, I still have no regrets about this purchase.

273851,"Quite a disappointment: The Chicago Symphony Chorus is famous for its excellence. Former chorusmaster Margaret Hillis was truly one of the greatest choral conductors of our time. She was a taskmaster, demanding precision and perfection, which she usually received. I counted myself lucky to sing a local ""Messiah"" concert under her direction a few years ago. What a tremendous experience to learn from this master. Imagine my disappointment when I bought this cd of Brahms' choral gem. The choral singing is incredibly insensitive. It's more of a scream-fest than a requiem. The only redeeming factor is the solo work. Kathleen Battle shines in this chestnut for sopranos. The sound is thrilling: clear and expressive. She spins a line of gold. For a satisfying listening experience of this work, I resort to Shaw's recording with the Atlanta Symphony and Chorus. Sadly, the solo work is not on the same level as the choral singing! If only we could merge the Chicago solo work with the Atlanta recording!

It was a nice tour for this Yankee, but there were not enough outdoor scenes of beautiful Savannah, one of my complaints of the film. Also, Chablis, though amusing at first, was definitely overdone, and this character wears very thin after a while. The rest was all in all superb, the scenes in the Mercer House all well done, and the acting just as good. Nice wry humor with Cusik/writer character too. The mystery aspect also different, but maybe the voodoo could have been played down a bit. Could have been a masterpiece, but not quite.

It contains information about the design, construction, and the first years of history covering the 1920s. It is illustrated with black and white photographs and a well reproduced ground plan. This publication was a project of the Friends of the Schindler House, a non-profit, that owns the historic landmark property in West Hollywood.

Really dumb, not enough blood and the reason given as to why the guy is killing people is really stupid.Just walk away.

47640,"Subtle Message: Wow- I was a little nervous to read this book, while at only 130 pages it is very unassuming...after reading 1984 in HS, I was dubious of enjoying anything of George Orwells. Perhaps I have grown up, or perhaps this is a much easier, and more interesting/intelligable read. Either way, I enjoyed Animal Farm!Some parts I couldn't help but laugh at the subtle irony, other parts got me thinking on a deeper level but all through out the book I was curious where the story was going, how it would end and what ""the point was"". (I chose to read the Foreward, last, so as not to get any spoilers.)I think this was a great subtle novel. I can see why it may be required reading in school, one of the reasons I enjoyed it was that it was an ""easy"", straight forward read! Gets you thinking...that's always a good thing!

238082,"One Of The Best Films Of The Year: I surprised at how many people have given this film bad reviews. In this day of CGI fests, it was a breath of fresh air to see a well crafted western come along. Sure it isn't a shoot em up, but it's more of a character study, like ""The Shootist"". In the next twenty years, this movie will find it's place. It is a shame that some cannot appreciate it now.The Blu Ray is visually stunning, especially the many outdoor scenes. The sound is top notch as well. But, what stands out the most are the superb performances from Pitt and Affleck. Don't let any of these naysayers keep you from watching a great film. Highly Recommended.

The DVDs were fine and play good, but I'm disappointed on how they were shipped. I don't want my money back on the dvds all I want is to make sure you do a better job on shipping your items in next time.

195203,"Another Masterpiece: As usual David Weber has more than made me satisfied with my $25 purchase. I eagerly anticipate the next installment of the Honor Harrington universe.I disagree with some of the previous reviewers. I like the fact that he is adding more background to his universe and less action. Mix things up a little.

209616,"Worth the price, needs more legos: This lego set is great for toddlers/preschoolers. Considering the high price of Thomas the train toys, I think this is actually worth its price. We got it for our 3-yr-old son who loves Thomas and loves playing with the duplo legos. We also got the large box of duplo legos, which was really necessary to give him a chance to really get creative. He makes up some interesting trains, but I think it's only because he has so many legos to work with. So if this is your child's only duplo legos, you might not be as satisfied with the 'playing' results unless you purchase a small box of duplos to go with it.

166419,"""The Dream House"" is the only good track on here.: This has to be one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard. The only stand-out track is ""The Dream House"", (played during the opening credits), but everything else sounds awful. I've listened to it a few times to try and like it but I just don't. Boring. But that's just my opinion. For those who are thinking of getting this, don't buy it from Amazon, save your $60 and visit a website called The House Of Mysterious Secrets, they sell CD-R versions of horror soundtracks for $4.95 and Nightmare 3 is one of them.

109030,"nice steal: The movie is based on various ideas appropriated (without acknowledgment) from Philip Dick's novels. This much it shares with recent Inception, but is less coherent. The movie is really not that bad, but it could use higher budget and better acting.

19421,"""Drink and be one of us..."": This is a great vamp flick. It is about a newly divorced mother and her sons who move into Santa Carla, a city overriden with vampires. Michal, her oldest son, becomes one of these creatures by falling in love with Star, a demi-vampire. He then tries to stop the others and fight what he had become. While being a good movie plot-wise, I think that the protagonists were a bit on the corny side and am truly amazed that they won. All in all, it's something to see if you're a vampire movie enthusiast.

29215,"Better than the movie?: YES! This book gets better every time I read it. After reading it 5 times through, I feel I'm about ready to head out and do some fly-fishing! Late at night my family gathers around the fireplace as I read them passages from the book. I'm hoping my kids will grow up just like those boys. Ever since i first read this book, my life has changed. Im starting to pay my taxes, my family life is great, and i have more friends than ever. Every month i go out and by a new copy of the book, acting as if i've never read it before. If i could give this book more than 5 stars, i sure would. My relationship with my girlfriends are great now! and my wife says I'm beginning to act like the man she married again. THANK YOU norman f. madean. thank you!

256457,"The Best RE yet: This is the best in the RE series yet. It looks wonderful on Dreamcast. Clear and fluid graphics with solid gameplay. The ability to use 2 weapons in 2 different directions is a new feature that has really added to gameplay and gives the player an opportunity to make it safely through tight situations. It is a must buy, if you have a new Dreamcast make this one of your first games!

I got a feeling there's more to this than they're telling us, it's not a ""difficult"" decision.

200693,"Hollywood - promoting the Antichrist again?: Content: Antichrist Language: foul Dialog: almost no value added Acting: average Humour: where? Role model value: -9 (on a scale -10 to 10)In few words, this is just another piece of Hollywood trash.Quoting myself: ""I don't like to play the role of the critic or judge."" But this movie is worthy of my expressing my impressions:1. I grew tired of the profanities very fast - I lost track of the dialog 2. I did not like the gore/violence 3. I did not like anything 4. I fell asleepThe movie is heading straight to the trash compactor.

The stories on this DVD center around Hong Kong and probe deeply into Culp's and Cosby's characters and the nature of loyalty. If you haven't discovered the secret of I Spy, buy this DVD.
